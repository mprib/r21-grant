trunk kinematics during level walking in normal subjects, to establish a

preliminary baseline for comparison to future research in gait analysis,

and aid in the identification of pathological gait. Seventeen volunteers

between the ages of 20 and 50, who met criteria for normal subjects,

participated. Trunk kinematic data were collected using an optoelectronic

technique. An ensemble average of trunk kinematic data in each of the

cardinal planes was plotted in degrees of motion versus percentage of gait

@article{Roelker.2019,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Although walking speed is the most common measure of gait performance post-stroke, improved walking speed following rehabilitation does not always indicate the recovery of paretic limb function. Over the last decade, the measure paretic propulsion (Pp, defined as the propulsive impulse generated by the paretic leg divided by the sum of the propulsive impulses of both legs) has been established as a measure of paretic limb output and recently targeted in post-stroke rehabilitation paradigms. However, the literature lacks a detailed synthesis of how paretic propulsion, walking speed, and other biomechanical and neuromuscular measures collectively relate to post-stroke walking performance and motor recovery.

OBJECTIVE

The aim of this review was to assess factors associated with the ability to generate Pp and identify rehabilitation targets aimed at improving Pp and paretic limb function.

METHODS

Relevant literature was collected in which paretic propulsion was used to quantify and assess propulsion symmetry and function in hemiparetic gait.

RESULTS

Paretic leg extension during terminal stance is strongly associated with Pp. Both paretic leg extension and propulsion are related to step length asymmetry, revealing an interaction between spatiotemporal, kinematic and kinetic metrics that underlies hemiparetic walking performance. The importance of plantarflexor function in producing propulsion is highlighted by the association of an independent plantarflexor excitation module with increased Pp. Furthermore, the literature suggests that although current rehabilitation techniques can improve Pp, these improvements depend on the patient's baseline plantarflexor function.

SIGNIFICANCE

Pp provides a quantitative measure of propulsion symmetry and should be a primary target of post-stroke gait rehabilitation. The current literature suggests rehabilitation techniques that target both plantarflexor function and leg extension may restore paretic limb function and improve gait asymmetries in individuals post stroke.},

@article{Rauter.2015,
 abstract = {In literature, the effectiveness of haptics for motor learning is controversially discussed. Haptics is believed to be effective for motor learning in general; however, different types of haptic control enhance different movement aspects. Thus, in dependence on the movement aspects of interest, one type of haptic control may be effective whereas another one is not. Therefore, in the current work, it was investigated if and how different types of haptic controllers affect learning of spatial and temporal movement aspects. In particular, haptic controllers that enforce active participation of the participants were expected to improve spatial aspects. Only haptic controllers that provide feedback about the task's velocity profile were expected to improve temporal aspects. In a study on learning a complex trunk-arm rowing task, the effect of training with four different types of haptic control was investigated: position control, path control, adaptive path control, and reactive path control. A fifth group (control) trained with visual concurrent augmented feedback. As hypothesized, the position controller was most effective for learning of temporal movement aspects, while the path controller was most effective in teaching spatial movement aspects of the rowing task. Visual feedback was also effective for learning temporal and spatial movement aspects.},

@article{Pohl.2002,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE

A new gait training strategy for patients with stroke seeks to increase walking speed through treadmill training. This study compares the effects of structured speed-dependent treadmill training (STT) (with the use of an interval paradigm to increase the treadmill speed stepwise according to principles of sport physiology) with limited progressive treadmill training (LTT) and conventional gait training (CGT) on clinical outcome measures for patients with hemiparesis.

METHODS

Sixty ambulatory poststroke patients were each randomly selected to receive 1 of the 3 different gait therapies: 20 subjects were treated with STT, 20 subjects were trained to walk on a treadmill with a 20{\%} increase of belt speed over the treatment period (LTT), and 20 subjects were treated with CGT. Treatment outcomes were assessed on the basis of overground walking speed, cadence, stride length, and Functional Ambulation Category scores.

RESULTS

After a 4-week training period, the STT group scored significantly higher than the LTT and CGT groups for overground walking speed (STT versus LTT, P{\textless}0.001; STT versus CGT, P{\textless}0.001), cadence (STT versus LTT, P=0.007; STT versus CGT, P{\textless}0.001), stride length (STT versus LTT, P{\textless}0.001; STT versus CGT, P{\textless}0.001), and Functional Ambulation Category scores (STT versus LTT, P=0.007; STT versus CGT, P{\textless}0.001).

CONCLUSIONS

Structured STT in poststroke patients resulted in better walking abilities than LTT or CGT. This gait training strategy provides a dynamic and integrative approach for the treatment of gait dysfunction after stroke.},

 abstract = {Background: Following stroke static as well as dynamic components of

postural control were affected. Ability to maintain postural alignment is

also a vital component of the postural control system. Pelvic asymmetry is

commonly observed in stroke subjects which can influence trunk control.

However, there is a paucity of literature that determines the relationship

between pelvic alignment and trunk control in subjects with stroke. Aim:

To analyze the relationship between pelvic alignments using PALM and trunk

control as measured by the Trunk Impairment Scale (TIS). Setting:

Inpatient rehabilitation unit, Tertiary Care Hospitals, Mangalore. Design:

A cross-sectional study. Subjects: 38 supra-tentorial stroke subjects with

more than 3 weeks duration and who can be able to sit independently were

recruited. Methods: The medio-lateral pelvic alignment of the stroke

subjects was measured in sitting using the PALM{\^a},,$\backslash$textcent. The deviation in the

pelvic tilt on the paretic side in comparison to the non-paretic side was

measured in degrees. Following which the trunk control was evaluated using

the Trunk Impairment Scale. Results: The correlation between the pelvic

correlation which indicates that a change in the pelvic alignment which

affects the trunk control. Pelvic tilt values negatively correlated with

all the sub-items of trunk impairment scores (p {\textless} 0.00). The pelvic tilt

@article{Moseley.2005,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Treadmill training, with or without some body weight supported using a harness, is a method of treating walking after stroke. A systematic review is required to assess the cost, effectiveness, and acceptability of this treatment.

OBJECTIVES

To assess the effectiveness of treadmill training and body weight support, individually or in combination, in the treatment of walking after stroke. The primary outcomes investigated were walking speed, endurance and dependency.

SEARCH STRATEGY

We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched 2 March 2005), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 4, 2004), MEDLINE (1966 to January 2005), EMBASE (1980 to February 2005), CINAHL (1982 to February 2005) and PEDro (last searched 2 March 2005). In addition, we handsearched relevant conference proceedings, screened reference lists and contacted trialists to identify further published and unpublished trials.

SELECTION CRITERIA

Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled and cross-over trials of treadmill training and body weight support, individually or in combination, for the treatment of walking after stroke were eligible.

DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS

Two authors independently selected trials, extracted data, and assessed quality. We contacted trialists for additional information. We used a fixed-effect model for analysis, but if heterogeneity existed a random-effects model was used. We analysed the results as weighted mean differences (WMD) for continuous variables and relative risk (RR) for dichotomous variables.

MAIN RESULTS

Fifteen trials (622 participants) were included. There were no statistically significant differences between treadmill training, with or without body weight support, and other interventions for walking speed or dependence. Among participants who could walk independently at the start of treatment, treadmill training with body weight support tended to produce higher walking speeds (WMD 0.09 m/s, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) -0.02 to 0.20 for speed; fixed-effect), but this result was not statistically significant. An individual trial tended to support the use of treadmill training with body weight support for dependent walkers as compared to treadmill training alone. One of three individual trials indicated that independent walkers may benefit from treadmill training combined with other task-orientated exercise. However, data are very limited. Adverse events occurred more frequently in participants receiving treadmill training but these were not judged to be clinically serious events.

AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS

Overall no statistically significant effect of treadmill training with or without body weight support was detected. Although individual studies suggested that treadmill training with body weight support may be more effective than treadmill training alone and that treadmill training plus task-oriented exercise may be more effective than sham exercises, further trials are required to confirm these findings.},

@article{Molier.2010,
 abstract = {PURPOSE

To investigate the effect of different aspects and types of augmented feedback on motor functions and motor activities of the hemiparetic arm after stroke.

METHOD

Systematic search of the scientific literature was performed in the Pubmed and Cochrane database from 1975 to March 2009. The augmented feedback used in the intervention was classified with respect to aspects (nature, timing and frequency) and types (auditory, sensory and visual).

RESULTS

The systematic literature search resulted in 299 citations. On the basis of inclusion and exclusion criteria, 23 full-text articles were included for analysis. There are some trends in favour of providing augmented knowledge of performance feedback, augmented auditory and combined sensory and visual feedback. No consistent effects on motor relearning were observed for summary or faded, terminal or concurrent, solely visual or solely sensory augmented feedback.

CONCLUSIONS

On the basis of this study, it was not possible to determine which combinations of aspects and types of augmented feedback are most essential for a beneficial effect on motor activities and motor functions of the hemiparetic arm after stroke. This was due to the combination of multiple aspects and types of augmented feedback in the included studies. This systematic review indicates that augmented feedback in general has an added value for stroke rehabilitation.},

@article{Likhi.2013,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Attainment of functional independence is the ultimate goal of a sound stroke rehabilitation program. Good trunk stability is essential for balance and extremity use. Stroke patients may have upper extremity impairments that may affect functional activity and lower extremity impairments that may hinder mobility. Hence, quantifying the specific levels of impairment in the trunk, upper extremity, and lower extremity is helpful to determine the extent to which each might influence the ability to perform activities of daily living.

OBJECTIVE

To assess the impairment of the trunk and the upper and lower extremity of stroke patients and correlate it with overall function.

METHODS

A cross-sectional repeated correlation study. Twenty-three subjects with a first-time stroke, between 50 and 75 years of age, of both genders, admitted in hospital within 5 weeks of stroke onset were included using purposive sampling technique. On the eighth day of the stroke, trunk impairment was assessed using the Trunk Impairment Scale, upper and lower limb impairment was assessed using the Simplified Stroke Rehabilitation Assessment of Movement (upper and lower limb subscale, respectively), and overall function was measured by FIM.

RESULTS

Trunk activity showed highly significant correlation (r = 0.598, P = .003) with overall function compared with upper limb activity (r = 0.501, P = .015). Lower limb impairment showed no correlation with overall function (r = 0.208, P = .342).

CONCLUSIONS

The overall functional independence in acute stroke patients is most closely correlated with the levels of impairments of trunk function, followed by upper limb impairments.},

and Methods] Fifteen stroke patients and 15 age- and gender-matched

well as trunk flexion and extension at a self-selected speed. A Qualisys

[Results] Patients presented larger mediolateral displacement of the

center of mass during all limb and trunk movements, and larger velocity of

center of mass during hip flexion movement. Healthy subjects showed

greater movement velocity during shoulder flexion, trunk flexion and

extension. Patients' clinical measurements only correlated with movement

characteristics during voluntary trunk motions. [Conclusion] Trunk

stability in patients with chronic stroke was compromised during voluntary

trunk as well as non-paretic limb movements, and the voluntary trunk

movements reflected the trunk deficits measured using clinical

measurements. Rehabilitation of patients with chronic stroke should

@article{Li.2018,
 abstract = {Walking dysfunction occurs at a very high prevalence in stroke survivors. Human walking is a phenomenon often taken for granted, but it is mediated by complicated neural control mechanisms. The automatic process includes the brainstem descending pathways (RST and VST) and the intraspinal locomotor network. It is known that leg muscles are organized into modules to serve subtasks for body support, posture and locomotion. Major kinematic mechanisms are recognized to minimize the center of gravity (COG) displacement. Stroke leads to damage to motor cortices and their descending corticospinal tracts and subsequent muscle weakness. On the other hand, brainstem descending pathways and the intraspinal motor network are disinhibited and become hyperexcitable. Recent advances suggest that they mediate post-stroke spasticity and diffuse spastic synergistic activation. As a result of such changes, existing modules are simplified and merged, thus leading to poor body support and walking performance. The wide range and hierarchy of post-stroke hemiplegic gait impairments is a reflection of mechanical consequences of muscle weakness, spasticity, abnormal synergistic activation and their interactions. Given the role of brainstem descending pathways in body support and locomotion and post-stroke spasticity, a new perspective of understanding post-stroke hemiplegic gait is proposed. Its clinical implications for management of hemiplegic gait are discussed. Two cases are presented as clinical application examples.},

{\textless}i{\textgreater}Objective{\textless}/i{\textgreater}: To determine, using the Muscular Utilization Ratio (MUR) method, whether plantarflexor weakness is among the factors preventing stroke subjects from walking at faster speeds. Potential compensations by the hip flexors were also examined.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}

{\textless}i{\textgreater}Design{\textless}/i{\textgreater}: A convenience sample of 17 chronic stroke subjects in a context of a descriptive study.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}

{\textless}i{\textgreater}Background{\textless}/i{\textgreater}: Gait speed is correlated with the residual strength of the muscles involved in gait in stroke subjects. However, it has not been established if this residual strength limits gait speed.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}

{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods{\textless}/i{\textgreater}: Kinetic and kinematic data for comfortable and maximal gait speeds were collected on the paretic side, and were used to determine the moments in plantarflexion (mechanical demand; MUR numerator) during the push-off phase. The maximal potential moment (MUR denominator) of the plantarflexors during gait was predicted using an equation derived from dynamometric data collected with a Biodex system. The MURs of the plantarflexors were then calculated at every 1{\%} interval of the push-off phase. The pull-off phase of gait and the hip flexor strength were also examined.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}

{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results{\textless}/i{\textgreater}: Ten subjects of the sample had a MUR value between 80 and 150{\%} at maximal gait speed. These subjects produced the lowest peak torques in plantarflexion. Each of the four fastest subjects of this group had a large hip flexion moment during the pull-off phase of gait and produced high hip flexion torque values on the dynamometer. Each of the seven remaining subjects had a MUR value under 70{\%} when they walked at maximal speed.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}

{\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions{\textless}/i{\textgreater}: Weakness of the plantarflexors should be considered as one factor limiting gait speed in 10 hemiparetic subjects. Some subjects with weak plantarflexors could walk rapidly because they compensated with the hip flexors. For the remaining stroke subjects, factors other than weakness of the plantarflexors have to be considered in order to explain the reduction in their gait speed.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

 abstract = {Concurrent augmented feedback has been shown to be less effective for learning simple motor tasks than for complex tasks. However, as mostly artificial tasks have been investigated, transfer of results to tasks in sports and rehabilitation remains unknown. Therefore, in this study, the effect of different concurrent feedback was evaluated in trunk-arm rowing. It was then investigated whether multimodal audiovisual and visuohaptic feedback are more effective for learning than visual feedback only. Na{\"i}ve subjects (N = 24) trained in three groups on a highly realistic virtual reality-based rowing simulator. In the visual feedback group, the subject's oar was superimposed to the target oar, which continuously became more transparent when the deviation between the oars decreased. Moreover, a trace of the subject's trajectory emerged if deviations exceeded a threshold. The audiovisual feedback group trained with oar movement sonification in addition to visual feedback to facilitate learning of the velocity profile. In the visuohaptic group, the oar movement was inhibited by path deviation-dependent braking forces to enhance learning of spatial aspects. All groups significantly decreased the spatial error (tendency in visual group) and velocity error from baseline to the retention tests. Audiovisual feedback fostered learning of the velocity profile significantly more than visuohaptic feedback. The study revealed that well-designed concurrent feedback fosters complex task learning, especially if the advantages of different modalities are exploited. Further studies should analyze the impact of within-feedback design parameters and the transferability of the results to other tasks in sports and rehabilitation.},

 abstract = {Augmented feedback, provided by coaches or displays, is a well-established strategy to accelerate motor learning. Frequent terminal feedback and concurrent feedback have been shown to be detrimental for simple motor task learning but supportive for complex motor task learning. However, conclusions on optimal feedback strategies have been mainly drawn from studies on artificial laboratory tasks with visual feedback only. Therefore, the authors compared the effectiveness of learning a complex, 3-dimensional rowing-type task with either concurrent visual, auditory, or haptic feedback to self-controlled terminal visual feedback. Results revealed that terminal visual feedback was most effective because it emphasized the internalization of task-relevant aspects. In contrast, concurrent feedback fostered the correction of task-irrelevant errors, which hindered learning. The concurrent visual and haptic feedback group performed much better during training with the feedback than in nonfeedback trials. Auditory feedback based on sonification of the movement error was not practical for training the 3-dimensional movement for most participants. Concurrent multimodal feedback in combination with terminal feedback may be most effective, especially if the feedback strategy is adapted to individual preferences and skill level.},

@article{Wishart.2002,
 abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of aging and the role of augmented visual information in the acquisition of a new bimanual coordination pattern, namely a 90° relative phase pattern. In a pilot study, younger and older adults received augmented visual feedback in the form of a real-time orthogonal display of both limb movements after every fifth trial. Younger adults acquired this task over three days of practice and retained the task well over periods of one week and one month of no practice while the older adults showed no improvement at all on the task. It was hypothesized that the amount of augmented information was not sufficient for the older adults to overcome the strong tendency to perform natural, intrinsically stable coordination patterns, which consequently prevented them from learning the task. The present study evaluated the age-related role of augmented visual feedback for learning the new pattern. Participants were randomly assigned within age groups to receive either concurrent or terminal visual feedback after every trial in acquisition. In contrast to the pilot study, all of the older adults learned the pattern, although not to the same level as the younger adults. Both younger and older adults benefitted from concurrent visual feedback, but the older adults gained more from the concurrent feedback than the younger adults, relative to terminal feedback conditions. The results suggest that when learning bimanual coordination patterns, older adults are more sensitive to the structure of the practice conditions, particularly the availability of concurrent visual information. This greater sensitivity to the learning environment may reflect a diminished capacity for inhibitory control and a decreased ability to focus attention on the salient aspects of learning the task.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS

Trunk performance is an important predictor of functional outcome after stroke. However, the percentage of explained variance varies considerably between studies. This may be explained by the stroke population examined, the different scales used to assess trunk performance and the time points used to measure outcome. The aim of this multicentre study was to examine the predictive validity of the Trunk Impairment Scale (TIS) and its subscales when predicting the Barthel Index score at 6 months after stroke.

METHODS

A total of 102 subjects were recruited in three European rehabilitation centres. Participants were assessed on admission (median time since stroke onset 20 days) and 6 months after stroke. Correlation analysis and forward stepwise multiple regression analysis were used to model outcome.

RESULTS

The best predictors of the Barthel Index scores at 6 months after stroke were total TIS score (partial R2 = 0.52, p{\textless}.0001) and static sitting balance subscale score (partial R2 = 0.50, p{\textless}.0001) on admission. The TIS score on admission and its static sitting balance subscale were stronger predictors of the Barthel Index score at 6 months than the Barthel Index score itself on admission.

CONCLUSIONS

This study emphasises the importance of trunk performance, especially static sitting balance, when predicting functional outcome after stroke. The TIS is recommended as a prediction instrument in the rehabilitation setting when considering the prognosis of stroke patients. Future studies should address the evolution of trunk performance over time and the evaluation of treatment interventions to improve trunk performance.},

To give a systematic review of clinical measurement scales used to assess trunk performance after stroke.

DATA SOURCES

The databases CINAHL, Cochrane, Pedro and PubMed were searched with the terms 'sitting balance' plus 'stroke' and 'trunk' plus 'stroke' mentioned in the title or abstract. Databases were searched from inception to January 2006.

REVIEW METHODS

All articles were selected which reported or included a clinical measure of trunk performance used in an adult stroke population. Reference lists were searched as secondary sources of articles.

RESULTS

A total of 458 articles resulted from the database search. Thirty-two articles were eligible for inclusion. Earlier studies mentioned ordinal single items or a combination of items which are part of a larger scale used to assess sitting balance as a derived measure of trunk performance. Three clinical tools were available which specifically evaluated trunk performance after stroke; the Trunk Control Test and two Trunk Impairment Scales.

CONCLUSION

Ordinal single items or subscales of existing larger scales lack a systematic evaluation of psychometric characteristics. Both Trunk Impairment Scales have been extensively examined. A comparative study assessing psychometric properties of the Trunk Control Test and two Trunk Impairment Scales could determine which should be the measure of choice when assessing trunk performance after stroke.},

The Trunk Impairment Scale (TIS) is a standardized scale to evaluate the trunk function in stroke patients. It was the aim of this study to determine the discriminant ability of the TIS by comparing stroke patients with healthy individuals. Further, the variables that had an influence on obtaining a high score on the TIS in healthy subjects were examined.

METHOD

Forty stroke patients and 40 age- and sex-matched healthy individuals were included in the study. TIS scores from the stroke patients and healthy individuals were compared using the Wilcoxon ranked sum test.

RESULTS

Sub-scale and total TIS scores showed significant differences between stroke patients and healthy individuals (P {\textless} 0.0001). Univariate analysis and logistic regression analysis further revealed that younger persons, women and people who are more active in daily life have a higher chance of obtaining a high score on the TIS.

CONCLUSIONS

The TIS discriminates between stroke patients and healthy individuals. A submaximal score on the TIS was found in 45{\%} of the healthy subjects suggesting that a lower score on the TIS still indicates normal trunk function and full participation in daily life.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Physical therapy (PT) is one of the key disciplines in interdisciplinary stroke rehabilitation. The aim of this systematic review was to provide an update of the evidence for stroke rehabilitation interventions in the domain of PT.

METHODS AND FINDINGS

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) regarding PT in stroke rehabilitation were retrieved through a systematic search. Outcomes were classified according to the ICF. RCTs with a low risk of bias were quantitatively analyzed. Differences between phases poststroke were explored in subgroup analyses. A best evidence synthesis was performed for neurological treatment approaches. The search yielded 467 RCTs (N = 25373; median PEDro score 6 [IQR 5-7]), identifying 53 interventions. No adverse events were reported. Strong evidence was found for significant positive effects of 13 interventions related to gait, 11 interventions related to arm-hand activities, 1 intervention for ADL, and 3 interventions for physical fitness. Summary Effect Sizes (SESs) ranged from 0.17 (95{\%}CI 0.03-0.70; I(2) = 0{\%}) for therapeutic positioning of the paretic arm to 2.47 (95{\%}CI 0.84-4.11; I(2) = 77{\%}) for training of sitting balance. There is strong evidence that a higher dose of practice is better, with SESs ranging from 0.21 (95{\%}CI 0.02-0.39; I(2) = 6{\%}) for motor function of the paretic arm to 0.61 (95{\%}CI 0.41-0.82; I(2) = 41{\%}) for muscle strength of the paretic leg. Subgroup analyses yielded significant differences with respect to timing poststroke for 10 interventions. Neurological treatment approaches to training of body functions and activities showed equal or unfavorable effects when compared to other training interventions. Main limitations of the present review are not using individual patient data for meta-analyses and absence of correction for multiple testing.

CONCLUSIONS

There is strong evidence for PT interventions favoring intensive high repetitive task-oriented and task-specific training in all phases poststroke. Effects are mostly restricted to the actually trained functions and activities. Suggestions for prioritizing PT stroke research are given.},

@article{vanCriekinge.2017,
 abstract = {Stroke commonly results in trunk impairments that are associated with

decreased trunk coordination and limited trunk muscle strength. These

impairments often result in biomechanical changes during walking.

Additionally, the so-called pelvic step might be influenced by these

impairments. Therefore, the aim of this review was twofold. First, to gain

more insight into trunk biomechanics during walking in stroke patients

compared to healthy individuals. Second, to investigate the influence of

walking speed on trunk biomechanics. The search strategy was performed by

the PRISMA guidelines and registered in the PROSPERO database (no.

CRD42016035797). Databases MEDLINE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library,

ScienceDirect, and Rehabdata were systematically searched until December

2016. Sixteen of the 1099 studies met the eligibility criteria and were

included in this review. Risk of bias was assessed by the Newcastle-Ottawa

Scale. The majority of studies reported on trunk kinematics during

walking, data on trunk kinetics and muscle activity is lacking. Following

stroke, patients walk with increased mediolateral trunk sway and larger

sagittal motion of the lower trunk. Although rotation of the upper trunk

is increased, the trunk shows a more in-phase coordination. Acceleration

of the trunk diminishes while instability and asymmetry increase as there

are less movement towards the paretic side. However, it is of great

importance to differentiate between compensatory trunk movements and

intrinsic trunk control deficits. Specific exercise programs, assistive

devices and orthoses might be of help in controlling these deficits.

Importantly, studies suggested that more natural trunk movements were

observed when walking speed was increased.},

@article{Thikey.2012,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Increasing evidence suggests that use of augmented visual feedback could be a useful approach to stroke rehabilitation. In current clinical practice, visual feedback of movement performance is often limited to the use of mirrors or video. However, neither approach is optimal since cognitive and self-image issues can distract or distress patients and their movement can be obscured by clothing or limited viewpoints. Three-dimensional motion capture has the potential to provide accurate kinematic data required for objective assessment and feedback in the clinical environment. However, such data are currently presented in numerical or graphical format, which is often impractical in a clinical setting. Our hypothesis is that presenting this kinematic data using bespoke visualisation software, which is tailored for gait rehabilitation after stroke, will provide a means whereby feedback of movement performance can be communicated in a more meaningful way to patients. This will result in increased patient understanding of their rehabilitation and will enable progress to be tracked in a more accessible way.

METHODS

The hypothesis will be assessed using an exploratory (phase II) randomised controlled trial. Stroke survivors eligible for this trial will be in the subacute stage of stroke and have impaired walking ability (Functional Ambulation Classification of 1 or more). Participants (n = 45) will be randomised into three groups to compare the use of the visualisation software during overground physical therapy gait training against an intensity-matched and attention-matched placebo group and a usual care control group. The primary outcome measure will be walking speed. Secondary measures will be Functional Ambulation Category, Timed Up and Go, Rivermead Visual Gait Assessment, Stroke Impact Scale-16 and spatiotemporal parameters associated with walking. Additional qualitative measures will be used to assess the participant's experience of the visual feedback provided in the study.

DISCUSSION

Results from the trial will explore whether the early provision of visual feedback of biomechanical movement performance during gait rehabilitation demonstrates improved mobility outcomes after stroke and increased patient understanding of their rehabilitation.

@article{Sorrentino.2018,
 abstract = {INTRODUCTION

Stroke may result in decreased trunk muscle strength and limited trunk coordination, frequently determining loss of autonomy due to the trunk impairment. Furthermore, sitting balance has been repeatedly identified as an important predictor of motor and functional recovery after stroke. Given the importance of the trunk, it is therefore mandatory that validated tools be available to assess its performance. A systematic review of the currently available clinical measurement tools to assess trunk performance after stroke has been carried out.

EVIDENCE ACQUISITION

We searched the PubMed database from January 2006 to April 2017 to select articles which reported or included a clinical measure of trunk performance used in an adult stroke population. The data collected were integrated with the results of a previous review published in 2006. A total of 302 articles were identified, of which 19 were eligible for inclusion.

EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS

Numerous clinical tools have been validated to assess trunk performance after stroke, including the Trunk Control Test, the Trunk Impairment Scale, the Postural Assessment Scale for Stroke, the Ottawa Sitting Scale, the Modified Functional Reach Test, the Function In Sitting Test, the Physical Ability Scale, the Trunk Recovery Scale, the Balance Assessment in Sitting and Standing Positions, and the and Sitting-Rising Test.

CONCLUSIONS

Several scales and tests have been demonstrated to be valid for assessing trunk performance in stroke. Some of these have already been refined by Rasch analysis to increase their psychometric characteristics. Further psychometric analysis of these tools in large and different samples is, however, still needed.},

@article{vanCriekinge.2020,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Trunk function and lower limb strength seem to be the primary predictors for functional independence in acute stroke patients. Gaining a better understanding of their relationship during walking aids in the identification of intrinsic trunk control deficits and underlying lower limb deficits resulting in compensatory trunk movements.

METHODS

Fifty-seven subjects with stroke and 57 age- and gender-matched subjects without disability were included. Participants underwent an instrumented gait analysis with a standard total body Plug-In-Gait model, a clinical examination of the lower limbs based on range of motion, strength, muscle tone and several clinical assessment scales such as the Trunk Impairment Scale, Tinetti test and Functional Ambulation Categories. Spatiotemporal parameters and joint angular time profiles were compared between healthy adults and stroke survivors with severe and mild to moderate lower limb impairments. Spm1d was used to compare the joint angular time profiles between groups.

FINDINGS

Truncal deviations are present during hemiplegic walking, sub-acute stroke survivors walked with increased thoracic tilt, a neutral frontal position of the pelvis during stance, a pelvic hike during swing, and a more rotated position without crossing of the midline. Patients with more severe lower limb impairments had more pronounced deficits in truncal motion.

INTERPRETATION

Setting accurate rehabilitation goals is of major importance during stroke, as well as understanding the underlying mechanisms and causes of the truncal impairments. Although more compensatory trunk deviations were seen in participants with severe lower limb impairments, they should not be considered as the sole contributor of trunk impairments during walking. Results of this study suggest that intrinsic trunk deficits during walking are also present after stroke.},

@article{Chen.2005,
 abstract = {Treadmill walking was used to assess the consistent gait differences between six individuals with post-stroke hemiparesis and six non-disabled, healthy controls at matched speeds. The hemiparetic subjects walked on the treadmill at their comfortable speeds, while each control walked at the same speed as the hemiparetic subject with whom he or she was matched. Kinematic and insole pressure data were collected from multiple, steady-state gait cycles. A large set of gait differences found between hemiparetic and non-disabled subjects was consistent with impaired swing initiation in the paretic limb (i.e., inadequate propulsion of the leg during pre-swing, increased percentage swing time, and reduced knee flexion at toe-off and mid-swing in the paretic limb) and related compensatory strategies (i.e., pelvic hiking and swing-phase propulsion and circumduction of the paretic limb). Exaggerated positive work associated with raising the trunk during pre-swing and swing of the paretic limb, consistent with pelvic hiking, contributed to increased mechanical energetic cost during walking. A second set of gait differences found was consistent with impaired single limb support on the paretic limb (i.e., shortened support time on the paretic limb) and related compensatory strategies (i.e., exaggerated propulsion of the non-paretic limb during pre-swing to shorten its swing time). Other significant gait differences included asymmetry in step length and increased step width. We conclude that consistent gait differences exist between hemiparetic and non-disabled subjects walking at matched speeds. The differences provide insights, concerning hemiparetic impairment and related compensatory strategies, that are in addition to the observation of slow walking speed.},

 abstract = {This systematic review synthesized and analyzed clinical findings related to the effectiveness of innovative technological feedback for tackling functional gait recovery. An electronic search of PUBMED, PEDro, WOS, CINAHL, and DIALNET was conducted from January 2011 to December 2016. The main inclusion criteria were: patients with modified or abnormal gait; application of technology-based feedback to deal with functional recovery of gait; any comparison between different kinds of feedback applied by means of technology, or any comparison between technological and non-technological feedback; and randomized controlled trials. Twenty papers were included. The populations were neurological patients (75{\%}), orthopedic and healthy subjects. All participants were adults, bar one. Four studies used exoskeletons, 6 load platforms and 5 pressure sensors. The breakdown of the type of feedback used was as follows: 60{\%} visual, 40{\%} acoustic and 15{\%} haptic. 55{\%} used terminal feedback versus 65{\%} simultaneous feedback. Prescriptive feedback was used in 60{\%} of cases, while 50{\%} used descriptive feedback. 62.5{\%} and 58.33{\%} of the trials showed a significant effect in improving step length and speed, respectively. Efficacy in improving other gait parameters such as balance or range of movement is observed in more than 75{\%} of the studies with significant outcomes.

CONCLUSION

Treatments based on feedback using innovative technology in patients with abnormal gait are mostly effective in improving gait parameters and therefore useful for the functional recovery of patients. The most frequently highlighted types of feedback were immediate visual feedback followed by terminal and immediate acoustic feedback.},

Single-blinded, randomized, controlled, comparative preliminary study was carried out. Patients were recruited from the inpatient unit of a Rehabilitation Hospital. Thirty-one patients who had experienced hemiplegic stroke were randomly assigned to three groups: the heel group (gait training by active weight bearing on the paretic heel with auditory feedback), the forefoot group (gait training with auditory feedback from paretic metatarsals), and the control group (general gait intervention). All patients performed 30 min of comprehensive rehabilitation therapy followed by an additional 20 min of gait intervention with or without auditory feedback three times a week for 6 weeks. Significant improvements in walking and balancing variables were observed after gait training in all three groups (P{\textless}0.05). However, significantly larger gains were identified in the heel group than in the control group (center of loading path length, -29.4 vs. -11.4{\%}, d=-1.0; center of loading path velocity, -35.8 vs. -19.6{\%}, d=-1.4).

and social participation, and it is frequently limited after stroke. A

lack of knee flexion during the swing phase (stiff knee) is one of the

impairments that restrict walking ability among patients with hemiparetic

spasticity. Our purpose was to study the effect of Botulinum toxin type A

(BoNT A) injections in several spastic muscles on the impairment,

activity, participation, and quality of life of patients with chronic

stroke presenting with a stiff knee gait. METHODS: Twenty chronic

hemiparetic poststroke patients with stiff knee gait and ability to walk

on a treadmill were recruited. BoNT A was injected into several spastic

muscles: the rectus femoris (200 U), semitendinosus (100 U) and triceps

surae (200 U). Patients' neurological impairments (Ashworth scale,

Duncan-Ely test, Stroke Impairment Assessment Set, and instrumented gait

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Trunk control has been identified as an important early predictor of functional outcome after stroke but there is insufficient evidence that proximal stability of the trunk is a pre-requisite for sitting and standing balance, walking, and functional activities.

OBJECTIVE

We systematically reviewed the literature on trunk training exercises (TTE) in adult patients with stroke. To establish if TTE can improve trunk performance and sitting balance.

METHODS

CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PEDro, REHABDATA Database, Scielo, Scopus, Web of Science, Trip Database, and Epistemonikos were searched and reference lists screened to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of trunk training exercises in stroke survivors. Two reviewers independently screened references, selected relevant studies, extracted data, and assessed trial quality. The primary outcomes were trunk performance and sitting balance. Due to the heterogeneity of included studies meta-analysis was not possible.

RESULTS

A total of 11 studies with 317 participants were analysed. Trunk training exercises showed a moderate evidence to improve trunk performance and dynamic sitting balance.

CONCLUSIONS

Trunk training exercises, performed with either stable or unstable surface, could be a good rehabilitation strategy and might help improving trunk performance and dynamic sitting balance after stroke.},

 abstract = {Prior to gait initiation (GI), anticipatory postural adjustments (GI-APA)

are activated in order to reorganize posture, favorably for gait. In

healthy subjects, the center of pressure (CoP) is displaced backward

during GI-APA, bilaterally by reducing soleus activities and activating

the tibialis anterior (TA) muscles, and laterally in the direction of the

leading leg, by activating hip abductors. In post-stroke hemiparetic

patients, TA, soleus and hip abductor activities are impaired on the

paretic side. Reduction in non-affected triceps surae activity can also be

observed. These may result in a decreased ability to execute GI-APA and to

generate propulsion forces during step execution. A systematic review was

conducted to provide an overview of the reorganization which occurs in

GI-APA following stroke as well as of the most effective strategies for

tailoring gait-rehabilitation to these patients. Sixteen articles were

included, providing gait data from a total of 220 patients. Stroke

patients show a decrease in the TA activity associated with difficulties

in silencing soleus muscle activity of the paretic leg, a decreased CoP

shift, lower propulsive anterior forces and a longer preparatory phase.

Regarding possible gait-rehabilitation strategies, the selected studies

show that initiating gait with the paretic leg provides poor balance. The

use of the non-paretic as the leading leg can be a useful exercise to

stimulate the paretic postural muscles.},

To understand the relationship between step length asymmetry and hemiparetic walking performance.

DESIGN

Descriptive.

SETTING

Gait analysis laboratory.

PARTICIPANTS

Convenience sample of 49 subjects with chronic hemiparesis.

INTERVENTIONS

Not applicable.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES

Subjects walked at their self-selected walking speed over both an instrumented mat and forceplates to collect spatiotemporal parameters and ground reaction forces, respectively. Step length asymmetry was quantified by using a step length ratio (SLR) defined as paretic step length divided by nonparetic step length. Paretic leg propulsion, self-selected walking speed, hemiparetic severity (assessed by Brunnstrom stages of motor recovery), and some spatiotemporal walking parameters quantified the hemiparetic walking performance. Paretic leg propulsion was quantified by the paretic propulsion (P(P)) ratio, calculated as the percentage contribution of paretic leg to the total propulsive impulse.

RESULTS

Significant negative correlation (r=-.78) was revealed between SLR and P(P), indicating that subjects generating less propulsive force with the paretic leg walked asymmetrically with longer paretic steps than nonparetic steps. SLR and self-selected walking speed revealed a weaker correlation (r=-.35), whereas hemiparetic severity correlated strongly with SLR (rho=-.53).

CONCLUSIONS

Step length asymmetry is related to propulsive force generation during hemiparetic walking. Subjects generating least paretic propulsion walk with relatively longer paretic steps. This suggests that one of the mechanisms for the longer paretic step may be the relatively greater compensatory nonparetic leg propulsion. Further, those with more severe hemiparesis (those dependent on abnormal flexor and extensor synergies) walk with the longest paretic steps relative to nonparetic. Finally, our results indicated that asymmetrical step lengths may not necessarily limit the self-selected walking speed, likely due to other compensatory mechanisms.},

@article{AurichSchuler.2019,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

A contralateral pelvic drop, a transverse rotation and a lateral translation of the pelvis are essential features of normal human gait. These motions are often restricted in robot-assisted gait devices. The optional FreeD module of the driven gait orthosis Lokomat (Hocoma AG, Switzerland) incorporates guided lateral translation and transverse rotation of the pelvis. It consequently should support weight shifting during walking. This study aimed to investigate the influence of the FreeD module on trunk kinematics and hip and trunk muscle activity.

METHODS

Thirty- one healthy adults participated. A video analysis of their trunk movements was performed to investigate the lateral chest and pelvis displacement within the Lokomat (with and without FreeD), and this was compared to treadmill walking. Furthermore, surface electromyography (sEMG) signals from eight muscles were collected during walking in the Lokomat (with and without FreeD), on the treadmill, and overground. To compare the similarity of the sEMG patterns, Spearman's correlation analyses were applied.

RESULTS

Walking with FreeD elicited a significantly higher lateral pelvis displacement and a lower lateral chest displacement (relative to the pelvis) compared to walking with a fixated pelvis. No significant differences in the sEMG patterns were found for the Lokomat conditions (with and without FreeD) when comparing it to treadmill or overground walking.

CONCLUSIONS

The differences in pelvis displacement act as a proof of concept of the FreeD module. The reduction of relative lateral chest movement corresponds to a decrease in compensatory trunk movements and has its origin in allowing weight shifting through the FreeD module. Both Lokomat conditions showed very similar muscle activity patterns of the trunk and hip compared to overground and treadmill walking. This indicates that the Lokomat allows a physiological muscle activity of the trunk and hip during gait.},

@article{Arvin.2016,
 abstract = {Previously it has been shown that constraining step width in gait

coincides with decreased trunk displacements. Conversely, external

stabilization of the upper body in gait coincides with decreased step

width, but this may in part be due to changes in passive dynamics of the

leg. In the present study, trunk kinematics during gait were constrained

without external stabilization by using an orthosis, to investigate

whether step width and dynamic gait stability in the ML direction are

changed in relation to trunk kinematics. Nine healthy young adults walked

on a treadmill at three different speeds with no intervention and while

wearing a thoracolumbar orthosis. Based on marker trajectories, trunk COM

displacement, body COM displacement and velocity, step width, and

margin-of-stability in ML direction were calculated. The results showed

that the orthosis significantly reduced trunk and body COM displacements.

As hypothesized, the restriction of trunk movement coincided with

significantly decreased step width, while the margin-of-stability was not

affected. These findings indicate that, when trunk movements are

constrained, humans narrow step width, while maintaining a constant

margin-of-stability. In conclusion, the present results in combination

with previous work imply that in gait a reciprocal coupling between trunk

kinematics and foot placement in the frontal plane subserves control of

@article{Allen.2014,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

A common measure of rehabilitation effectiveness post-stroke is self-selected walking speed, yet individuals may achieve the same speed using different coordination strategies. Asymmetry in the propulsion generated by each leg can provide insight into paretic leg coordination due to its relatively strong correlation with hemiparetic severity. Subjects walking at the same speed can exhibit different propulsion asymmetries, with some subjects relying more on the paretic leg and others on the nonparetic leg. The goal of this study was to assess whether analyzing propulsion asymmetry can help distinguish between improved paretic leg coordination versus nonparetic leg compensation.

METHODS

Three-dimensional forward dynamics simulations were developed for two post-stroke hemiparetic subjects walking at identical speeds before/after rehabilitation with opposite changes in propulsion asymmetry. Changes in the individual muscle contributions to forward propulsion were examined.

FINDINGS

The major source of increased forward propulsion in both subjects was from the ankle plantarflexors. How they were utilized differed and appears related to changes in propulsion asymmetry. Subject A increased propulsion generated from the paretic plantarflexors, while Subject B increased propulsion generated from the nonparetic plantarflexors. Each subject's strategy to increase speed also included differences in other muscle groups (e.g., hamstrings) that did not appear to be related to propulsion asymmetry.

INTERPRETATION

The results of this study highlight how speed cannot be used to elucidate underlying muscle coordination changes following rehabilitation. In contrast, propulsion asymmetry appears to provide insight into changes in plantarflexor output affecting propulsion generation and may be useful in monitoring rehabilitation outcomes.},

@article{Bruijn.2008,
 abstract = {In walking faster than 3 km/h, transverse pelvic rotation lengthens the step ({\textquotedbl}pelvic step{\textquotedbl}). It is often assumed that the thorax then starts to counter rotate to limit total body angular momentum around the vertical. But the relative timing of pelvis and thorax rotation during gait is insufficiently understood. The present study aimed at analysing how transverse pelvis and thorax rotations relate to the movements of the upper leg, and how these patterns contribute to total body angular momentum. Nine healthy male volunteers walked on a treadmill at nine different velocities, ranging from 2.0 km/h to 5.2 km/h. Full body kinematics were recorded. Femur-pelvis, pelvis-thorax, and femur-thorax relative phase were calculated, as well as transverse plane angular momentum of all body segments. The shift in pelvis-thorax coordination from in-phase to out of phase with increasing velocity was found to depend on the pelvis beginning to move in-phase with the femur, while the thorax continued to counter rotate with respect to the femur. Moreover, pelvic and thoracic contributions to total body angular momentum were low (less than 10{\%}), while contributions of the legs and arms were much larger (approximately 90{\%}), suggesting that pelvis-thorax coordination is relatively unimportant to the organisation of total body angular momentum. Taken together, these results may imply that our understanding of the pelvic step need to be changed. Moreover, the alterations in pelvis-thorax relative phase that were reported for different locomotor pathologies may depend on different mechanisms.},

study investigated isometric and isokinetic reciprocal trunk flexion and

patients and 40 healthy volunteers. The Berg balance scale was used to

assess balance and stability, and the FIM instrument was used to evaluate

functional disability in the patient group. Patients were evaluated as

soon as they were able to stand long enough for testing. RESULTS: Peak

torque values for trunk flexion and extension were lower in the stroke

patients than in the controls. The differences were significant for trunk

flexion and for trunk extension. In both groups, peak torque values for

trunk flexors were greater than peak torque values for trunk extensors.

There was a significant positive correlation between trunk muscle strength

and Berg balance scale score at discharge. Trunk muscle strength was not

correlated with FIM total score or FIM motor score, but the

locomotion-transfers FIM subscore at discharge was positively correlated

with trunk muscle torque values, except for isometric extension.

@article{Dickstein.2008,
 abstract = {PURPOSE: Walking speed is a cardinal indicator of poststroke gait

performance; however, no consensus exists regarding the optimal treatment

method(s) for its enhancement. The most widely accepted criterion for

establishing the contribution of treatment to walking speed is the gain in

speed. The actual speed, however, at the end of the intervention (final

speed) may be more important for functional community ambulation. This

review examines the contribution of the prevailing methods for gait

rehabilitation to final walking speed. METHOD: Walking speed information

was derived from studies included in meta-analyses, systematic reviews,

and clinical practice guidelines. Recent references, not included in the

mentioned sources, were incorporated in cases when gait speed was an

outcome variable. Final speed was assessed by the reported speed values

and by inferring the capacity for functional community walking at the end

of the intervention period. RESULTS: Similar outcomes for final walking

speed were found for the different prevailing treatment methods. Treatment

gains were likewise comparable and generally insufficient for upgrading

patients' functional community walking capacity. CONCLUSIONS: Different

treatment methods exist for poststroke gait rehabilitation. Their

availability, mode of application, and costs vary, yet outcomes are

largely similar. Therefore, choosing an appropriate method may be guided

by a pragmatic approach. Simple {\textquotedbl}low technology{\textquotedbl} and conventional exercise

to date is at least as efficacious as more complex strategies such as

 abstract = {OBJECTIVE

To study the EMG activity of selected trunk muscles during self-initiated voluntary flexion and extension of the trunk in post-stroke hemiparetic subjects, and to compare measurement results to corresponding findings in control subjects.

METHODS

Using a sample of 50 patients and 30 control subjects, bilateral EMG activity of the rectus abdominis (RA) and external oblique (EO) muscles was studied during direct trunk flexion, and activity of the lumbar erector spinae (ES) and latissimus dorsi (LD) was studied during straight trunk extension. Variables of timing, magnitude, and temporal synchronization between muscle activity on the paretic and non-paretic sides of the body in the patient group were compared with the same measurements taken from the left and right sides of the body in the control group.

RESULTS

Activity of the RA and LD muscles on the affected side of the body was reduced and delayed relative to the unaffected side in the patients and relative to the control subjects. Some deterioration was also observed in the function of the EO muscle, whereas the lumbar ES displayed normal activity on both sides of the body. Trunk velocity during both flexion and extension was slower in the patients than in the controls.

CONCLUSIONS

Despite the existence of ipsilateral as well as contralateral higher inputs to axial and to a lesser extent also to more lateral trunk muscles, the function of the superficial abdominal muscles and of the LD muscle is adversely affected by a contralateral stroke. Conversely, the lumbar ES, which can be categorized as local trunk extensors, seem to normally fulfill their anti-gravitational task on both sides of the body.},

 abstract = {The present study investigates the effects of different types of concurrent feedback on the acquisition of perceptual-motor skills. Twenty participants walked through virtual corridors in which rhythmically opening and closing sliding doors were placed. The participants aimed to adjust their walking speed so as to cross the doors when the doors were close to their maximal aperture width. The highest level of performance was achieved by learners who practiced the task with unambiguous self-controlled concurrent feedback, which is to say, by learners who could request that feedback at wish. Practice with imposed rather than self-controlled feedback and practice without concurrent feedback were shown to be less effective. Finally, the way in which the self-controlled concurrent feedback was presented was also found to be of paramount importance; if the feedback is ambiguous, it may even prevent participants from learning the task. Clearly, unambiguous self-controlled feedback can give rise to higher levels of performance than other feedback conditions (compared to imposed schedule) but, depending on the way it is presented, the feedback can also prevent the participants from learning the task. In the discussion it is argued that unambiguous self-controlled concurrent feedback allows learners to more rapidly educate their attention towards more useful perceptual invariants and to calibrate the relation between perceptual invariants and action parameters.},

@article{Hsieh.2002,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Prediction of activities of daily living (ADL)

functions at an early stage after a stroke is critical because it enables

clinicians to set treatment programs and goals. The objective of this

study was to assess the relationship between trunk control at an early

stage and comprehensive ADL function (as assessed by combining basic ADL

and instrumental ADL [IADL]) in patients at 6 months after stroke.

METHODS: A total of 169 stroke patients participated in this prospective

study. Trunk control was measured with the use of the trunk control items

of the Postural Assessment Scale for Stroke Patients (PASS-TC). In

addition to the PASS-TC score, age, sex, type of stroke, side of

hemiparesis, urinary incontinence, limb paresis (measured by the

Fugl-Meyer motor test), balance (measured by the Fugl-Meyer balance test),

and basic ADL (measured by the Barthel Index) were also selected as

predictor variables. These variables were assessed at 14 days after stroke

or earlier. The Barthel Index and Frenchay Activities Index (measuring

IADL) were administered at 6 months after stroke. The sum of the

standardized Barthel Index and standardized Frenchay Activities Index

scores was used to assess comprehensive ADL function. RESULTS:

Multivariable stepwise linear regression analysis showed that PASS-TC

score, age, Fugl-Meyer motor test score, and Barthel Index score (listed

by the order of forward selection) were the strongest predictors of

comprehensive ADL function. These results were internally validated with

the use of the bootstrap resampling technique. The PASS-TC score alone

accounted for 45{\%} of the variance in predicting comprehensive ADL

function. Results also indicated that the PASS-TC score had slightly more

power in predicting comprehensive ADL function than either the Fugl-Meyer

motor test score or Barthel Index score. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this

study provide strong evidence of the predictive value of trunk control on

comprehensive ADL function in stroke patients. The results imply that

early assessment and management of trunk control after stroke should be

emphasized.},

 abstract = {Current rehabilitation efforts for individuals poststroke focus on increasing walking speed because it is a predictor of community ambulation and participation. Greater propulsive force is required to increase walking speed. Previous studies have identified that trailing limb angle (TLA) and ankle moment are key factors to increases in propulsive force during gait. However, no studies have determined the relative contribution of these two factors to increase propulsive force following intervention. The purpose of this study was to quantify the relative contribution of ankle moment and TLA to increases in propulsive force following 12-weeks of gait training for individuals poststroke. Forty-five participants were assigned to 1 of 3 training groups: training at self-selected speeds (SS), at fastest comfortable speeds (Fast), and Fast with functional electrical stimulation (FastFES). For participants who gained paretic propulsive force following training, a biomechanical-based model previously developed for individuals poststroke was used to calculate the relative contributions of ankle moment and TLA. A two-way, mixed-model design, analysis of covariance adjusted for baseline walking speed was performed to analyze changes in TLA and ankle moment across groups. The model showed that TLA was the major contributor to increases in propulsive force following training. Although the paretic TLA increased from pre-training to post-training, no differences were observed between groups. In contrast, increases in paretic ankle moment were observed only in the FastFES group. Our findings suggested that specific targeting may be needed to increase ankle moment.},

Propulsive force generation is critical to walking speed. Trialing limb angle and ankle moment are major contributors to increases in propulsive force during gait. For able-bodied individuals, trailing limb angle contributes twice as much as ankle moment to increases in propulsive force during speed modulation. The aim of this study was to quantify the relative contribution of ankle moment and trailing limb angle to increases in propulsive force for individuals poststroke.

METHODS

A biomechanical-based model previously developed for able-bodied individuals was evaluated and enhanced for individuals poststroke. Gait analysis was performed as subjects (N = 24) with chronic poststroke hemiparesis walked at their self-selected and fast walking speeds on a treadmill.

RESULTS

Both trailing limb angle and ankle moment increased during speed modulation. In the paretic limb, the contribution from trailing limb angle versus ankle moment to increases in propulsive force is 74{\%} and 17{\%}. In the non-paretic limb, the contribution from trailing limb angle versus ankle moment to increases in propulsive force is 67{\%} and 22{\%}.

CONCLUSIONS

Individuals poststroke increase propulsive force mainly by changing trailing limb angle in both the paretic and non-paretic limbs. This strategy may contribute to the inefficiency in poststroke walking patterns. Future work is needed to examine whether these characteristics can be modified via intervention.},

@article{Hsiao.2016b,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Current rehabilitation for individuals poststroke focuses on increasing walking speed because it is an indicator of community walking ability and quality of life. Propulsive force generated from the paretic limb is critical to walking speed and may reflect actual neural recovery that restores the affected neural systems. A wide variation across individuals in the improvements in paretic propulsive force was observed following an intervention that targeted paretic propulsive force. This study aimed to determine if specific baseline characteristics can be used to predict patients who would respond to the intervention.

METHODS

Participants (N = 19) with chronic poststroke hemiparesis walked at their self-selected and maximal walking speeds on a treadmill before and after a 12-week gait training program. Propulsive forces from the paretic limb were analyzed. Pearson correlation coefficient was used to determine the relationships between (1) treatment gains in walking speed and propulsive force following intervention, and (2) treatment gains in propulsive force and baseline propulsive forces.

RESULTS

Treatment gains in self-selected walking speed were correlated to treatment gains in paretic propulsive force following intervention. In addition, changes in paretic propulsive force between self-selected and maximal walking speeds at baseline were strongly correlated to treatment gains in paretic propulsive force.

CONCLUSIONS

The capacity to modulate paretic propulsive force, rather than the absolute propulsive force during self-selected or maximal walking speed, predicted treatment gains in propulsive force following the intervention. Findings from this research could help to inform clinicians and researchers to target the appropriate patient population for rehabilitation interventions.},

 abstract = {OBJECTIVES

To study electromyographic characteristics of anticipatory postural adjustment in axial and lateral, posterior and anterior trunk muscles during the performance of upper-and lower-limb flexion tasks, in subjects with hemiparesis after stroke and to determine the relationship between anticipatory activity and subjects' motor and functional status.

DESIGN

A nonrandomized control study.

SETTING

Geriatric rehabilitation center in Israel.

PARTICIPANTS

Fifty poststroke hemiparetic patients and 30 healthy control subjects.

INTERVENTION

Electromyographic activity of the lumbar erector spinae and of the latissimus dorsi muscles was recorded bilaterally during flexion of either arm and from the 2 rectus abdominis and obliquus externus muscles during flexion of either hip.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES

Muscles' onset latency, cross-correlation values between the temporal activation profile of corresponding pairs and between ipsilateral muscular pairs, symmetry in activation magnitude of corresponding muscles, and relation between electromyographic activity and motor and functional performance

RESULTS

Onset latencies of trunk muscles were partially delayed in the patients with longest hindrance displayed by the erector spinae ipsilateral to the flexing arm (P{\textless}.04). Temporal synchronization between pertinent muscular pairs was lower in the patients than in the healthy subjects, with significant group differences (P{\textless}.05 or lower) in the correlations between ipsilateral pairs of trunk muscles. Activation of the corresponding lateral trunk muscles in the patients was significantly less symmetrical than in the controls (P{\textless}.03 or lower) because of reduced activity on the paretic body side, especially on flexing of the paretic limbs. Conversely, in the controls as well as on the nonparetic side of the patients, limb flexion was associated with increased activity in the ipsilateral lateral trunk muscle. The erector spinae muscle in both groups and on both sides was more active on the contralateral side than on the ipsilateral side to the flexing arm. The reduced activity level in trunk muscles on the paretic body side was associated with deficiencies in motor and functional abilities.

CONCLUSIONS

Major impairments in the activity of trunk muscles in hemiparetic subjects were manifested in the reduced activity level of the lateral trunk muscles, in delayed onset, and in reduced synchronization between activation of pertinent muscular pairs. These problems were associated with motor and functional deficits and warrant specific consideration during physical rehabilitation of post stroke hemiparetic patients.},

@article{Hsiao.2016c,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Recent rehabilitation efforts after stroke often focus on increasing walking speed because it is associated with quality of life. For individuals poststroke, propulsive force generated from the paretic limb has been shown to be correlated to walking speed. However, little is known about the relative contribution of the paretic versus the nonparetic propulsive forces to changes in walking speed.

OBJECTIVE

The primary purpose of this study was to determine the contribution of propulsive force generated from each limb to changes in walking speed during speed modulation within a session and as a result of a 12-week training program.

METHODS

Gait analysis was performed as participants (N = 38) with chronic poststroke hemiparesis walked at their self-selected and faster walking speeds on a treadmill before and after a 12-week gait retraining program.

RESULTS

Prior to training, stroke survivors increased nonparetic propulsive forces as the primary mechanism to change walking speed during speed modulation within a session. Following gait training, the paretic limb played a larger role during speed modulation within a session. In addition, the increases in paretic propulsive forces observed following gait training contributed to the increases in the self-selected walking speeds seen following training.

CONCLUSIONS

Gait retraining in the chronic phase of stroke recovery facilitates paretic limb neuromotor recovery and reduces the reliance on the nonparetic limb's generation of propulsive force to increase walking speed. These findings support gait rehabilitation efforts directed toward improving the paretic limb's ability to generate propulsive force.},

@article{Hollands.2012,
 abstract = {Impairments in gait coordination may be a factor in falls and mobility limitations after stroke. Therefore, rehabilitation targeting gait coordination may be an effective way to improve walking post-stroke. This review sought to examine current treatments that target impairments of gait coordination, the theoretical basis on which they are derived and the effects of such interventions. Few high quality RCTs with a low risk of bias specifically targeting and measuring restoration of coordinated gait were found. Consequently, we took a pragmatic approach to describing and quantifying the available evidence and included non-randomised study designs and limited the influence of heterogeneity in experimental design and control comparators by restricting meta-analyses to pre- and post-test comparisons of experimental interventions only. Results show that physiotherapy interventions significantly improved gait function and coordination. Interventions involving repetitive task-specific practice and/or auditory cueing appeared to be the most promising approaches to restore gait coordination. The fact that overall improvements in gait coordination coincided with increased walking speed lends support to the hypothesis that targeting gait coordination gait may be a way of improving overall walking ability post-stroke. However, establishing the mechanism for improved locomotor control requires a better understanding of the nature of both neuroplasticity and coordination deficits in functional tasks after stroke. Future research requires the measurement of impairment, activity and cortical activation in an effort to establish the mechanism by which functional gains are achieved.},

@article{Hacmon.2012,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Decreased walking speed after stroke may be

related to changes in temporal and distance gait factors, endurance, and

balance. Functional gait deficits may also be related to changes in

coordination, specifically between transverse (yaw) plane trunk movements.

Our aim was to determine the relationship between intersegmental

coordination during gait and functional gait and balance deficits in

individuals with stroke. METHODS: Eleven individuals with chronic stroke

and 11 age-matched subjects without disability participated in 2 sessions.

In Session 1, clinical evaluations of trunk/limb impairment

(Chedoke-McMaster Stroke Assessment), functional gait (Functional Gait

Assessment), and balance (BesTest) were performed. In Session 2, gait

kinematics during eight 30-second walking trials on a self-paced treadmill

at 2 speeds (comfortable and equivalent) were recorded. Equivalence of

walking speeds was obtained by asking subjects without disability to walk

approximately 20{\%} slower and subjects with stroke to walk approximately

20{\%} faster than their comfortable speed. Thorax and pelvis 3-dimensional

angular ranges of motion (ROMs) and intersegmental coordination using the

continuous relative phase were analyzed. RESULTS: Comfortable walking

speed was slower in subjects with stroke (0.78 m/s) than in subjects

without disability (1.22 m/s), despite matched cadences. At both

comfortable and equivalent walking speeds (0.97-0.98 m/s), participants

with stroke used more thoracic ROM than pelvic transverse ROM in

comparison with subjects without disability. Transverse thorax-pelvis

coordination was similar between groups when walking speeds were

equivalent, but there was more in-phase coordination in participants with

stroke walking at their comfortable, slower speed. In subjects with

stroke, thoracic ROM and continuous relative phase were correlated with

several clinical functional gait and balance measures. DISCUSSION AND

CONCLUSION: Changes in segmental transverse ROM and coordination were

associated with poor gait and with balance abilities in individuals with

stroke. Interventions focusing on recovery of these movement

characteristics may lead to better clinical outcomes.},

 abstract = {Robot-assisted devices are becoming a popular alternative to manual facilitation in stroke rehabilitation. These devices have the potential to reduce therapist burden and treatment costs; however, their effectiveness in terms of functional recovery remains in question. This pilot study compared the outcomes of a stroke rehabilitation program that incorporates robot-assisted gait training (RAGT) with a more traditional therapy program that does not. Twenty hemiparetic stroke patients were recruited at a rehabilitation hospital in Houston, Texas, and were randomly assigned to 2 groups. The control group (n = 10) received 24 1-hour sessions of conventional physical therapy, whereas the RAGT group (n = 10) received 24 1-hour sessions of conventional physical therapy combined with RAGT on a treadmill. Gait function was assessed before and after treatment by an 8-m walk test, a 3-minute walk test, and the Tinetti balance assessment. Both groups showed significant improvement in all 3 outcome measures following treatment (P {\textless} .05), but there was no difference between groups. It is concluded that RAGT may provide improvements in balance and gait comparable with conventional physical therapy. A larger multicenter trial is required to investigate the effectiveness of RAGT in hemiparetic stroke.},

 abstract = {The purpose of this study was to evaluate prospectively the Trunk Control Test (TCT) correlation at admission to rehabilitation with length of stay, functional independence measure (FIM), gait velocity, walking distance and balance measured at discharge in 28 hemiparetic patients. FIM and TCT were registered on admission. Outcome measures at discharge were: FIM, gait velocity, walking distance and balance assessed with the Berg Balance Scale and computerized posturography. TCT was significantly correlated with length of stay (r = -0.722), discharge FIM (r = 0.738), discharge motor FIM (r = 0.723), gait velocity (r = 0.654), walking distance (p = 0.003), centre of gravity symmetry r = 0.601) and Berg Balance Scale (r = 0.755). Initial TCT predicts the 52{\%} of the variation in length of stay and 54{\%} in the discharge FIM. The predictive value of a compound variable (TCT and admission FIM) reaches 60{\%} of the variation in length of stay and 66{\%} in the FIM at discharge.},

@article{Hornby.2020,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Individuals with acute-onset central nervous system (CNS) injury, including stroke, motor incomplete spinal cord injury, or traumatic brain injury, often experience lasting locomotor deficits, as quantified by decreases in gait speed and distance walked over a specific duration (timed distance). The goal of the present clinical practice guideline was to delineate the relative efficacy of various interventions to improve walking speed and timed distance in ambulatory individuals greater than 6 months following these specific diagnoses.

METHODS

A systematic review of the literature published between 1995 and 2016 was performed in 4 databases for randomized controlled clinical trials focused on these specific patient populations, at least 6 months postinjury and with specific outcomes of walking speed and timed distance. For all studies, specific parameters of training interventions including frequency, intensity, time, and type were detailed as possible. Recommendations were determined on the basis of the strength of the evidence and the potential harm, risks, or costs of providing a specific training paradigm, particularly when another intervention may be available and can provide greater benefit.

RESULTS

Strong evidence indicates that clinicians should offer walking training at moderate to high intensities or virtual reality-based training to ambulatory individuals greater than 6 months following acute-onset CNS injury to improve walking speed or distance. In contrast, weak evidence suggests that strength training, circuit (ie, combined) training or cycling training at moderate to high intensities, and virtual reality-based balance training may improve walking speed and distance in these patient groups. Finally, strong evidence suggests that body weight-supported treadmill training, robotic-assisted training, or sitting/standing balance training without virtual reality should not be performed to improve walking speed or distance in ambulatory individuals greater than 6 months following acute-onset CNS injury to improve walking speed or distance.

DISCUSSION

The collective findings suggest that large amounts of task-specific (ie, locomotor) practice may be critical for improvements in walking function, although only at higher cardiovascular intensities or with augmented feedback to increase patient's engagement. Lower-intensity walking interventions or impairment-based training strategies demonstrated equivocal or limited efficacy.

LIMITATIONS

As walking speed and distance were primary outcomes, the research participants included in the studies walked without substantial physical assistance. This guideline may not apply to patients with limited ambulatory function, where provision of walking training may require substantial physical assistance.

SUMMARY

The guideline suggests that task-specific walking training should be performed to improve walking speed and distance in those with acute-onset CNS injury although only at higher intensities or with augmented feedback. Future studies should clarify the potential utility of specific training parameters that lead to improved walking speed and distance in these populations in both chronic and subacute stages following injury.

DISCLAIMER

These recommendations are intended as a guide for clinicians to optimize rehabilitation outcomes for persons with chronic stroke, incomplete spinal cord injury, and traumatic brain injury to improve walking speed and distance.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Regaining locomotor ability is a primary goal in stroke

rehabilitation and is most commonly measured using changes in

self-selected walking speed. However, walking speed cannot identify the

mechanisms by which an individual recovers. Laboratory-based mechanistic

measures such as exercise capacity, muscle activation, force production,

and movement analysis variables may better explain neurologic recovery.

OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this systematic review are to examine

changes in mechanistic gait outcomes and describe motor recovery as

quantified by changes in laboratory-based mechanistic variables in

rehabilitation trials. METHODS: Following a systematic literature search

(in PubMed, Ovid, and CINAHL), we included rehabilitation trials with a

statistically significant change in self-selected walking speed

post-intervention that concurrently collected mechanistic variables.

Methodological quality was assessed using Cochrane Collaboration's tool.

Walking speed changes, mechanistic variables, and intervention data were

extracted. RESULTS: Twenty-five studies met the inclusion criteria and},
