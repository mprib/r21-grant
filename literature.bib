              differences between six individuals with post-stroke hemiparesis
              and six non-disabled, healthy controls at matched speeds. The
              hemiparetic subjects walked on the treadmill at their comfortable
              speeds, while each control walked at the same speed as the
              hemiparetic subject with whom he or she was matched. Kinematic
              and insole pressure data were collected from multiple,
              steady-state gait cycles. A large set of gait differences found
              between hemiparetic and non-disabled subjects was consistent with
              impaired swing initiation in the paretic limb (i.e., inadequate
              propulsion of the leg during pre-swing, increased percentage
              swing time, and reduced knee flexion at toe-off and mid-swing in
              the paretic limb) and related compensatory strategies (i.e.,
              pelvic hiking and swing-phase propulsion and circumduction of the
              paretic limb). Exaggerated positive work associated with raising
              the trunk during pre-swing and swing of the paretic limb,
              consistent with pelvic hiking, contributed to increased
              mechanical energetic cost during walking. A second set of gait
              differences found was consistent with impaired single limb
              support on the paretic limb (i.e., shortened support time on the
              paretic limb) and related compensatory strategies (i.e.,
              exaggerated propulsion of the non-paretic limb during pre-swing
              to shorten its swing time). Other significant gait differences
              included asymmetry in step length and increased step width. We
              conclude that consistent gait differences exist between
              hemiparetic and non-disabled subjects walking at matched speeds.
              The differences provide insights, concerning hemiparetic
              impairment and related compensatory strategies, that are in
              addition to the observation of slow walking speed.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to investigate and compare
              the coordination and stabilization of axial segments during
              walking with and without horizontal voluntary head turns, in
              healthy (n=5) and hemiparetic (n=10) subjects. METHODS: Subjects
              were instructed to turn the head as fast and as soon as possible
              in the direction indicated by an illuminated arrow signal (right,
              left or none) that was triggered at initial contact of the right
              (healthy) or paretic (hemiparetic) foot. Head, thorax, and pelvis
              motions were obtained from a 9-segment model using
              retro-reflective markers and a Vicon-512 system with 6
              high-resolution cameras. Coordination of axial segments in the
              horizontal plane was characterized using cyclographs and
              cross-correlation analyses. Stabilization of the segments was
              quantified using root mean square (RMS) values of the segment's
              normalized acceleration profile. RESULTS: The healthy subjects
              showed a direction-dependent modulation of axial segment
              coordination, with head turns toward and away from the stance
              limb favoring and hindering, respectively, the contra-rotational
              pattern of the thorax with respect to the pelvis during
              locomotion. Meanwhile, pelvis motions remained unaltered. This
              direction-specific modulation pattern was disrupted in the
              hemiparetic subjects, both in the spatial and temporal domains.
              Moreover, larger RMS values for head and thorax segments were
              observed in the hemiparetic groups, both with and without the
              superimposition of voluntary head motions. CONCLUSIONS: The
              findings suggest that: (1) head rotations during walking modify
              axial segment coordination in a direction-specific manner, (2)
              the pelvic rotations associated with locomotion remained
              unaffected by head rotations and (3) stroke alters this
              coordination behavior, which may contribute to balance
              dysfunctions during locomotion.",

              underpinning head stabilisation in young and older women during
              gait initiation. Eleven young (23.1 $\pm$ 1.1 yrs) and 12 older
              (73.9 $\pm$ 2.4 yrs) women initiated walking at comfortable speed
              while focussing on a fixed visual target at eye level. A
              stereophotogrammetric system was used to assess variability of

              mediolateral directions. Latency of muscle activation in the
              sternocleidomastoid, and upper and lower trunk muscles were
              determined by surface electromyography. Older displayed higher
              variability of head angular displacement, and a decreased ability
              to attenuate accelerations from trunk to head, compared to young
              in the anteroposterior but not mediolateral direction. Moreover,

  abstract = "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The limited walking ability that follows
              a stroke restricts the patient's independent mobility about the
              home and community, a significant social handicap. To improve the
              in-hospital prediction of functional outcome, the relationships
              between impairment, disability, and handicap were assessed with
              clinical measures in 147 stroke patients. METHODS: The patients'
              level of functional walking ability at home and in the community
              was assigned by expert clinicians to one of the six categories of
              a modified Hoffer Functional Ambulation scale at least 3 months
              after discharge. A 19-item questionnaire was further used to
              assess current customary mobility of the subjects. Functional
              muscle strength and proprioception were tested, and walking
              velocity was measured. RESULTS: The significant indicators of
              impairment, upright motor control knee flexion and extension
              strength, differentiated household from community ambulators. The
              addition of velocity improved the functional prediction.
              Proprioception was clinically normal in all walkers. The validity
              of the criteria for the six levels of walking handicap was
              confirmed statistically. Stepwise discriminant analysis reduced
              the ambulation activities on the questionnaire from 19 to 7.
              Redefinition of the criteria for patient classification using the
              coefficients and constants of the seven critical functions
              improved the prediction of patient walking ability to 84\%.
              CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study offer a quantitative
              method of relating the social disadvantage of stroke patients to
              the impairment and disability sustained. The measurement of
              therapeutic outcome in relation to the social advantage for the
              patient would allow more efficient standardization of treatment

              subjects were 230 healthy volunteers. Gait was timed over a 7.62
              m expanse of floor. Actual and height normalized speed were
              determined. Lower extremity muscle strength was measured with a
              hand-held dynamometer. RESULTS: mean comfortable gait speed
              ranged from 127.2 cm/s for women in their seventies to 146.2 cm/s
              for men in their forties. Mean maximum gait speed ranged from
              174.9 cm/s for women in their seventies to 253.3 cm/s for men in
              their twenties. Both gait speed measures were reliable
              (coefficients > or = 0.903) and correlated significantly with age
              (r > or = -0.210), height (r > or = 0.220) and the strengths of
              four measured lower extremity muscle actions (r = 0.190-0.500).
              The muscle action strengths most strongly correlated with gait

              extension (maximum speed). CONCLUSIONS: these normative values
              should give clinicians a reference against which patient
              performance can be compared in a variety of settings. Gait speed
              can be expected to be reduced in individuals of greater age and

              this study was to identify factors in patients associated with
              emotional distress in caregivers 1 year after stroke. METHODS:
              One-year stroke survivors with residual handicap (defined by the
              Oxford Handicap Scale) and their chief caregivers were
              interviewed as part of the follow-up activities for patients (n =
              492) registered with the Perth Community Stroke Study. We
              assessed emotional distress in caregivers using the Hospital
              Anxiety and Depression Scale and the 28-item General Health
              Questionnaire. Appropriate sections of the Social Behaviour
              Assessment Schedule were used to assess the patient's behavior
              and the impact on the caregiver's life. Other aspects of the
              patient's functional state were assessed with the Barthel Index,
              the Mini-Mental State Examination, the Frenchay Activities Index,
              and the Psychiatric Assessment Schedule (at 4 months after
              stroke). RESULTS: Of 241 patients who survived to 1 year after
              stroke and were living outside of an institution, 103 patients
              (43\%; 95\% confidence interval, 37\% to 49\%) were handicapped.
              Eighty-four patient/caregiver units were assessed from this
              latter group. Almost all caregivers reported adverse effects on
              their emotional health, social activities, and leisure time, and
              more than half reported adverse effects on family relationships.
              Forty-six caregivers (55\%) showed evidence of emotional distress
              on either of the two screening instruments, particularly if they
              were caregiving for patients with dementia and/or abnormal
              behavior. There was no significant relationship between emotional
              illness among caregivers and the degree of patients' physical
              disability. CONCLUSIONS: In this population, the high level of
              emotional distress among caregivers of stroke patients suggests
              that many caregivers have unmet needs. Community services need to
              focus attention on the neuropsychological aspects of stroke

              cross-sectional study. SETTING: University-based rehabilitation
              center. PARTICIPANTS: Subjects (N=62) with spastic hemiplegia.
              INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Walking
              endurance was measured by the distance covered in the six-minute
              walk test (6MWT). Ankle dorsiflexor and plantarflexor strength
              were measured using a load-cell mounted on a custom-built foot
              support. Plantarflexor spasticity was measured using the
              Composite Spasticity Scale. RESULTS: The six-minute walk
              distances showed stronger positive correlation with affected
              dorsiflexor strength (r=.793, P$\leq$.000) when compared with
              affected plantarflexor strength (r=.349, P=.005). Results of the
              regression model showed that after adjusting for basic
              demographic and stroke-related impairments, affected ankle
              dorsiflexor strength remained independently associated with
              six-minute walk distance, accounting for 48.8\% of the variance.

              independent determinant of walking endurance in stroke survivors
              with spastic plantarflexors. Our findings suggest that stroke

  abstract = "PURPOSE: Walking speed is a cardinal indicator of poststroke gait
              performance; however, no consensus exists regarding the optimal
              treatment method(s) for its enhancement. The most widely accepted
              criterion for establishing the contribution of treatment to
              walking speed is the gain in speed. The actual speed, however, at
              the end of the intervention (final speed) may be more important
              for functional community ambulation. This review examines the
              contribution of the prevailing methods for gait rehabilitation to
              final walking speed. METHOD: Walking speed information was
              derived from studies included in meta-analyses, systematic
              reviews, and clinical practice guidelines. Recent references, not
              included in the mentioned sources, were incorporated in cases

              by the reported speed values and by inferring the capacity for
              functional community walking at the end of the intervention
              period. RESULTS: Similar outcomes for final walking speed were
              found for the different prevailing treatment methods. Treatment
              gains were likewise comparable and generally insufficient for
              upgrading patients' functional community walking capacity.
              CONCLUSIONS: Different treatment methods exist for poststroke
              gait rehabilitation. Their availability, mode of application, and
              costs vary, yet outcomes are largely similar. Therefore, choosing
              an appropriate method may be guided by a pragmatic approach.

              patterns during asymmetric lifting in healthy individuals.
              OBJECTIVE: To investigate muscle recruitment patterns during
              asymmetric lifting, representing a common daily living activity,
              to determine whether systematic differences exist between
              functioning of the local and global muscle systems. SUMMARY OF
              BACKGROUND DATA: The normal function of the local muscle system
              is to provide sufficient segmental stability to the spine. The
              global muscle system provides general trunk stabilization and
              enables the static and dynamic work necessary for daily living
              and sports activities. Current knowledge about these two muscle
              groups appears to be specifically derived from anatomic findings
              and experiments conducted under artificial circumstances. To the
              authors' knowledge, the recruitment patterns of both muscle
              groups have not been investigated in daily living activities.
              METHODS: Twenty-nine healthy individuals performed different
              variants of asymmetric lifting activities. Electromyographic data
              were collected from seven hip, abdominal, and back muscle pairs.
              In addition, trunk kinematics were measured by means of an
              ultrasonic movement analysis system. RESULTS: The left and right
              obliquus internus, rectus femoris, and multifidus showed
              symmetric co-contraction in all variants of activities. In
              contrast, significant left/right differences were observed in the
              external oblique, gluteus maximus, iliocostalis lumborum pars
              thoracis, and latissimus dorsi. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this
              study show a symmetric activation of the local muscles during the
              performance of low-load, asymmetric lifting tasks, which suggests
              that these muscles play a stabilizing role during these
              manoeuvres. The global muscles, however, hand show asymmetric
              patterns of activation during the same tasks, supporting their
              role as global stabilizers and prime movers.",

  abstract = "PURPOSE: To investigate the nature of stroke induced functional
              disturbances of rectus abdominis and erector spinae in their
              postural and dynamic roles and compare the performances of stroke
              and neurologically unimpaired groups. METHODS: EMG activity was
              recorded from rectus abdominis and erector spinae during five
              rest/work cycles in forward and backward of vertical positions
              and during reaching and shoe donning. Repeated measures ANOVA was
              used to compare within and between group EMG activity to
              determine the significance of differences between paretic and
              non-paretic muscles of the stroke group and matched muscles of
              the control group in the two postures and dynamic tasks. RESULTS:
              In the stroke group rectus abdominis responded normally in most
              instances, demonstrating weakness only during shoe donning. This
              weakness was particularly noticeable on the paretic side. Erector
              spinae activity of the stroke group was significantly higher than
              the controls during all postural and dynamic work and at rest
              after most tasks particularly on the paretic side. CONCLUSION:
              Findings indicated that stroke appears to induce increased
              activity in erector spinae on both sides during postural and
              dynamic roles and at subsequent rest. By contrast, rectus
              abdominis performed reasonably normally after stroke with
              weakness noted only during dynamic postural support of shoe
              donning. Explanations for these differences might depend on the
              extent to which cortical influences to muscles are disrupted by
              stroke. Generous contributions from the intact hemisphere might
              enable more normal activity in rectus abdominis, whereas, the
              abnormal responses of erector spinae might reflect a more severe
              disruption of cortical influences on motor unit activity.",

              different velocities (i.e. 0.25-1.5 m s-1), with a focus on the
              transverse rotations of the trunk. Video recordings revealed, for
              both stroke patients and healthy subjects, similar relations
              between walking speed and stride length as well as stride
              frequency. The phase difference between pelvic and thoracic
              rotations (i.e. trunk rotation) and the total range of trunk
              rotation were almost linearly related to the walking speed.
              Healthy subjects showed a marked increase in pelvic rotation from
              1 to 1.5 m s-1. Using dimensional analysis in a comparison
              between stroke patients and healthy subjects, invariances in the
              coordination of gait were found for stride length, stride
              frequency, pelvic rotation, and trunk rotation. Constant
              relations were obtained between, on the one hand, dimensionless

              velocities 0.75 and 1 m s-1 for dimensionless pelvic rotation and
              trunk rotation, indicating that, from this velocity range
              onwards, pelvic swing lengthens the stride: rotations of pelvis,
              thorax and trunk become tightly coordinated. On the basis of the
              dimensionless stride length, stride frequency, pelvic rotation
              and trunk rotation, deficits in the gait of stroke patients could
              be quantified. It is concluded that walking speed is an important

              measured to indicate changes. We observed the effect of the
              pelvis fixation on these parameters while varying gait velocity
              (0.35, 0.60 and 0.90 m/s). It was shown that the fixation caused
              a reduction of step width by 33\%, and an increase of step length
              of 19\%. Sagittal and coronal trunk rotations changed with +68\%

              sclerosis (ALS), have a devastating effect on speech muscle
              function that often results in severe communication deficits.
              Over the course of bulbar disease, tongue and jaw movements are
              modified, but their impact on speech is poorly understood. The
              aim of this study was to determine the effect of disease-related
              changes in tongue-jaw movement coupling on speech intelligibility
              in persons at different stages of bulbar ALS. Method Parallel
              factor analysis was used to quantify the pattern of spatial
              coupling between 4 semi-independent regions of the tongue and the
              jaw in various vowels and consonants in 10 individuals with ALS
              and 10 healthy individuals, respectively, from the X-Ray
              Microbeam database (Westbury, 1994). The relation of spatial
              tongue-jaw coupling to speech intelligibility was examined in
              individuals at the early and late stages of bulbar ALS and
              healthy individuals. Results Tongue movement, independent of the
              jaw, decreased early and progressively, which negatively impacted
              speech intelligibility. Jaw contribution to tongue movement was
              increased during the early stages of bulbar ALS compared to that
              of the healthy subjects, which was followed by a decrease during
              the late stages of bulbar ALS. The early-stage increase of jaw
              contribution significantly improved speech intelligibility and is
              thus most likely to be an adaptive strategy to mitigate the
              negative impact of tongue movement reductions on speech
              intelligibility. This adaptive strategy became unavailable during
              the late stages of bulbar ALS, which might accelerate
              intelligibility decline. Conclusions The loss of functional
              tongue-jaw coupling may be the critical physiological factor
              leading to the eventual loss of functional speech in ALS.
              Monitoring changes in tongue-jaw coupling may improve the

              significantly deteriorated gait performance. Although the gait of
              stroke survivors has been evaluated at the primary level
              pertaining to ankle, knee, and hip motions, secondary deviations
              involving the pelvic motions are strongly related to the primary
              level. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify the
              kinematic differences of the primary and secondary joints and to
              identify mechanism differences that alter the gait performance of
              stroke survivors. [Subjects and Methods] Five healthy subjects
              and five stroke survivors were recruited. All the subjects were
              instructed to walk at a self-selected speed. The joint kinematics
              and gait parameters were calculated. [Results] For the stroke
              survivors, the range of motion of the primary-joint motions were
              significantly reduced, and the secondary-joint motions were
              significantly increased. Additionally, for the healthy subjects,
              the primary joint kinematics were the main factors ensuring gait
              performance, whereas for the stoke survivors, the secondary-joint
              motions were the main factors. [Conclusion] The results indicate
              that while increasing the range of motion of primary-joint
              movements is the main target to achieve, there is a strong need
              to constrain and support pelvic motions in order to improve the

              for the adaptation of the stride to environmental constraints
              (obstacle avoidance, for example). Controlling the propulsive
              forces during the stance and/or controlling the pendular movement
              of the oscillating leg constitute the two potential and
              non-exclusive mechanisms underlying intentional stride length
              modulation. The present experiment was conducted in order to
              determine if these two mechanisms contribute to voluntary length
              modulation and, if so, how they cooperate according to whether
              the subject has to lengthen or shorten a stride and how these
              mechanisms are implemented at the neuromuscular level. Subjects
              had to produce a temporarily modulated stride of the same length,
              but originating from two different initial steady-states: one
              from shorter stride length and one from longer stride length. We
              found that the shortening was essentially realized by a
              swing-duration decrease (an increased activity in the hip
              extensor--biceps femoris--during the swing of the ipsilaterally
              shortened stride stopped the pendular leg movement earlier). The
              lengthening was realized by two mechanisms: (1) an increase in
              the propulsive forces (via an increased activity of the ankle
              extensor muscles--soleus--and the hip extensors--biceps
              femoris--from the stance of the ipsilaterally modulated stride,
              which was prolonged during the following stance of the
              contralateral leg), and (2) an increase in swing duration on the
              ipsilateral leg (an increased activity in hip and ankle
              flexors--rectus femoris and tibialis anterior--maintained the
              ipsilateral leg in flexion during the lengthened swing so that
              the foot landed later). In this experiment, the subjects were
              faced with a spatial constraint of the same magnitude in the
              direction of stride lengthening and stride shortening. However,
              under these conditions, subjects used a different balance between
              swing control (that directly modifies the foot trajectory without
              affecting the trajectory of the head-arm-trunk system) and/or the
              control of propulsive forces (that indirectly influences foot
              trajectory by modifying the trajectory of the head-arm-trunk
              system). In the first case, this concerns a voluntary control of
              gesture produced by the legs and usually implicated in the
              locomotor pointing; in the second case, this concerns a voluntary

              applied during sit-to-stand (STS) transfers in persons with
              spinal cord injury (SCI) by using functional electrical
              stimulation (FES) applied to lower limbs muscles. MATERIALS AND
              METHODS: A new FES system has been used to automatically trigger
              muscle stimulation of the lower limbs, at the desired moment in
              regards to trunk motion. The objective was to decrease arm
              participation during STS motion of a person with complete
              paraplegia and low-level tetraplegia. Six participants with
              chronic SCI participated in the study. Participants with SCI were
              recruited to complete STS movement using a new system for
              FES-assisted STS transfer. All participants attended one muscle
              mapping session to test their muscles condition, two training
              sessions to become familiarized with the experimental setup, and
              two measurement sessions using the proposed system for
              FES-assisted STS movement. The applied arm forces during STS
              movement were recorded and analyzed for different stimulation
              onset values with respect to the maximal trunk acceleration
              signal using one-way ANOVA statistical test. Post-hoc analysis
              was performed using Tukey's method. RESULTS: The results of this
              study showed that the moment of the stimulation onset has an
              influence on the arm forces applied during the STS motion. The
              lowest values of arm forces were obtained for STS movements where
              the electrical stimulation was triggered before and around the
              time corresponding to the maximal value of the trunk acceleration
              signal. CONCLUSION: Lowest arm forces values were obtained for
              STS motions that were similar to those of healthy persons in
              terms of trunk movements and beginning of lower limb movements in
              regards to maximal trunk acceleration signal. The FES system was
              able to mimic the rising motion of a healthy individual by
              triggering the FES at the appropriate moment. This method could

              studies could have been avoided if preceded by smaller single-arm
              phase II studies to evaluate the futility of proceeding to phase
              III. METHODS: To provide examples of the application of phase II
              methodology, we obtained primary outcome data for the active
              treatment group of 6 phase III ischemic stroke therapy trials.
              For each study, we estimated the sample size number required for
              a multistage single-arm study using parameters specified in the
              original study. We evaluated outcome data for the first number of
              subjects in the phase III study treatment arm ordered by
              enrollment dates. We compared the proportion of favorable
              outcomes to prespecified stopping criteria derived from a
              single-arm phase II futility design. If the observed proportion
              of favorable outcomes was less than the stopping criterion, we
              declared the treatment not sufficiently effective to warrant

              as futile in phase II; none of 3 showed treatment efficacy in
              phase III. In the 3 remaining phase II trials in which we did not
              show futility, one showed efficacy in phase III. CONCLUSIONS:
              Single-arm phase II futility studies have been underused in

              (naming) for individuals with long-term poststroke aphasia.
              Design, Setting, and Participants: Double-blinded, prospective
              randomized clinical trial using a futility design to test
              adjunctive A-tDCS during speech therapy. The setting was an
              outpatient clinic. Enrollment of individuals began in August 2012

              was 6 months. Analyses began in April 2017. The study recruited
              from a volunteer sample, and 89 patients were screened. Patients
              with long-term (>6 months) aphasia due to 1 previous left
              hemisphere stroke were enrolled. In comparing A-tDCS and sham
              tDCS, patients were matched based on site (University of South
              Carolina or Medical University of South Carolina), baseline age,
              type of aphasia, and aphasia severity. Interventions: Outpatient
              speech therapy for 3 weeks (15 sessions, 45 minutes each)
              combined with either A-tDCS vs sham tDCS applied to preserved

              primary outcome was the ability to name common objects, assessed
              twice before and after therapy. Results: A total of 74 patients
              were enrolled. Participants had a mean (SD) age of 60 (10) years,
              had 15 (2) years of education, and were 44 (40) months from
              stroke onset. There were 52 men (70\%) and 62 non-Hispanic white
              individuals (84\%). Most were retired or not employed (59
              [80\%]). Broca aphasia was the most common aphasia type (39
              [52.7\%]). The adjusted mean (SE) change from pretreatment
              baseline in correct naming was 13.9 (2.4) words (95\% CI,
              9.0-18.7) for A-tDCS and 8.2 (2.2) words (95\% CI, 3.8-12.6) for
              sham tDCS, with mean (SE) A-tDCS difference of 5.7 (3.3) words
              (95\% CI, -0.9 to 12.3), indicating a relative 70\% increase in
              correct naming for A-tDCS relative to sham. The futility
              hypothesis P value was .90, indicating failure to reject the null
              hypothesis and, therefore, providing no evidence that further
              study of A-tDCS is futile. No serious adverse events were

              investigation was to use a novel analysis technique to
              objectively measure weight transfer during double support (DS) in
              healthy individuals and individuals with hemiplegia secondary to
              stroke with and without an ankle foot orthosis. STUDY DESIGN:
              Prospective, Repeated measures, case-controlled trial. METHODS:
              Participants included 25 adults with stroke-related hemiplegia >6
              months using a prescribed ankle foot orthosis and 12 age-matched
              healthy controls. Main outcome measures included the weight
              transfer point timing (WTP, \%DS), maximum total force timing
              (MTF, \%DS), timing difference between WTP and MTF (MTF-WTP,
              \%DS) and the linearity of loading (LOL, R(2)) during the DS
              phase of the gait cycle. RESULTS: The WTP and LOL were
              significantly different between conditions with and without the
              ankle foot orthosis for the affected and unaffected limb in
              post-stroke individuals, p $\leq$ 0.01. The MTF and difference in
              timing between MTF-WTP were significantly different during
              affected limb loading with and without the ankle foot orthosis in
              the stroke group, p $\leq$ 0.0001 and p = 0.03, respectively.
              MTF, MTF-WTP and LOL were significantly different between
              individuals with stroke (during affected limb loading) and
              healthy controls (during right limb loading). CONCLUSIONS: This
              research established a systematic method for analysing weight
              transfer during walking to evaluate the effect of an ankle foot
              orthosis on loading during double support in hemiplegic gait.
              This novel method can be used to elucidate biomechanical
              mechanisms behind orthosis-mediated changes in gait patterns and
              quantify functional mobility outcomes in rehabilitation. CLINICAL

               pretreatment functional MRI scan administered during overt
               picture naming with the reference cathode electrode placed on
               the contralateral forehead. A-tDCS (1 mA; 20-minute) was
               compared with sham tDCS (S-tDCS) in a crossover design.
               Participants received 10 sessions of computerized anomia
               treatment; 5 sessions included A-tDCS and 5 included S-tDCS.
               RESULTS: Coupling A-tDCS with behavioral language treatment
               reduced reaction time during naming of trained items immediately
               posttreatment (Z=1.96, P=0.025) and at subsequent testing 3
               weeks later (Z=2.52, P=0.006). CONCLUSIONS: A-tDCS administered
               during language treatment decreased processing time during
               picture naming by fluent aphasic participants. Additional
               studies combining A-tDCS, an inexpensive method with no reported
               serious side effects, with behavioral language therapy are

               left hemisphere cortical activity, primarily of the left frontal
               cortex, is associated with improved naming performance in stroke
               patients with aphasia. Our aim was to determine whether anodal
               transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS), a method thought
               to increase cortical excitability, would improve naming accuracy
               in stroke patients with aphasia when applied to the scalp
               overlying the left frontal cortex. METHODS: Ten patients with
               chronic stroke-induced aphasia received 5 days of anodal tDCS (1
               mA for 20 minutes) and 5 days of sham tDCS (for 20 minutes,
               order randomized) while performing a computerized anomia
               treatment. tDCS positioning was guided by a priori functional
               magnetic resonance imaging results for each individual during an
               overt naming task to ensure that the active electrode was placed
               over structurally intact cortex. RESULTS: Results revealed
               significantly improved naming accuracy of treated items
               (F[1,9]=5.72, P<0.040) after anodal tDCS compared with sham
               tDCS. Patients who demonstrated the most improvement were those
               with perilesional areas closest to the stimulation site.
               Crucially, this treatment effect persisted at least 1 week after
               treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that anodal tDCS
               over the left frontal cortex can lead to enhanced naming
               accuracy in stroke patients with aphasia and, if proved to be
               effective in larger studies, may provide a supplementary
               treatment approach for anomia.",

  abstract = "INTRODUCTION: Transcutaneous neuromuscular electrical stimulation
              (NMES) can generate muscle contractions for rehabilitation and
              exercise. However, NMES-evoked contractions are limited by
              fatigue when they are delivered ``conventionally'' (CONV) using a
              single active electrode. Researchers have developed
              ``sequential'' (SEQ) stimulation, involving rotation of pulses
              between multiple ``aggregated'' (AGGR-SEQ) or ``distributed''
              (DISTR-SEQ) active electrodes, to reduce fatigue (torque-decline)
              by reducing motor unit discharge rates. The primary objective was
              to compare fatigue-related outcomes, ``potentiation,''
              ``variability,'' and ``efficiency'' between CONV, AGGR-SEQ, and
              DISTR-SEQ stimulation of knee extensors in healthy participants.
              METHODS: Torque and current were recorded during testing with
              fatiguing trains using each NMES type under isometric and
              isokinetic (180°/s) conditions. RESULTS: Compared with CONV
              stimulation, SEQ techniques reduced fatigue-related outcomes,
              increased potentiation, did not affect variability, and reduced
              efficiency. CONCLUSIONS: SEQ techniques hold promise for reducing
              fatigue during NMES-based rehabilitation and exercise; however,
              optimization is required to improve efficiency. Muscle Nerve 56:

               illustrates how hundreds of cells operate as a functional entity
               to produce a highly deterministic output. The coherent action of
               the pool depends largely on the distribution of input to its
               members through the connections of afferent fibres. Three types
               of spike-triggered averaging have been utilized to study these
               connections. Impulses in individual Ia afferents elicit
               excitatory postsynaptic potentials ('single-fibre' EPSPs) in
               about 80\% of homonymous MNs. After spinal transection 100\% may
               respond, suggesting that Ia fibres project anatomically to all
               homonymous MNs. Functionally absent Ia connections are due to
               transmission failure. The sum of all the EPSPs elicited in a
               large population of MNs was recorded electrotonically from
               ventral roots. The mean amplitudes of these 'postsynaptic
               population potentials' (PSPPs) were correlated with the
               conduction velocities (CVs) of the Ia or spindle group II
               fibres. The greater the distance between the spinal entry point
               of a Ia fibre and the ventral root, the smaller was the PSPP.
               Tape recording of multiple afferents and the responses of up to
               24 MNs permitted study of as many as 264 possible connections in
               a single, acute experiment. Construction of wiring diagrams and
               connectivity matrices from the data showed that functional
               connectivity is influenced by afferent fibre size, the effect of
               branching on fibre size, MN size and probably transmission
               failure, but that on a cell-to-cell level, connectivity does not
               follow strict, deterministic rules. The results raise the
               question of how probabilistic connections between afferent
               fibres and MNs give rise to deterministic outputs from the whole

  title     = "Henneman's Size Principle: The Right Name",
  author    = "Fuglevand, Andrew J",
  abstract  = "In their letter ``Renaming the `Henneman Size Principle'{}'' (26
               June, p. 2031), J. A. Vilensky and S. Gilman correctly point out
               that Denny-Brown and Pennybacker ([1][1]) made a landmark
               observation in the 1930s when they showed that mammalian motor
               units tend to be activated in a fixed sequence from the weakest
               to the strongest units. This finding, however, does not
               represent the ``size principle'' as Vilensky and Gilman suggest;
               rather, it describes the phenomenon of orderly recruitment. It
               was not until the seminal work of Elwood Henneman in Science
               (Reports, 27 Dec. 1957, p. 1345) that the neural mechanisms
               underlying orderly recruitment began to be revealed. On the
               basis of innovative experiments and biophysical reasoning,
               Henneman and his colleagues proposed that the amount of
               excitatory input required to activate a motoneuron is directly
               related to its size (surface area of soma and dendrites). It was
               argued, therefore, that activation of motoneurons should proceed
               from smallest to largest as the broadly distributed excitatory
               input to a pool of motoneurons ([2][2]) increases. Moreover,
               smaller (and more excitable) motor neurons have thinner axons
               that give rise to proportionately fewer terminal branches, which
               in turn innervate smaller numbers of muscle fibers.
               Consequently, recruitment progresses ``automatically'' from weak
               to strong muscle units. These ideas, rightfully referred to as
               ``Henneman's size principle,'' not only explain the phenomenon
               of orderly recruitment originally observed by Denny-Brown and
               Pennybacker, but also represent one of the few parsimonious and
               testable hypotheses describing the functional organization of
               any population of neurons. 1. [↵][3]1. D. Denny-Brown, 2. J. B.

               \{\#article-title-2\} The seminal importance of the Denny-Brown
               and Pennybacker paper ([1][1]) was discussed in several reviews
               of the historical development of the ``size principle''
               ([2][2]). Moreover, Henneman and his co-workers were aware of
               the Denny-Brown and Pennebacker observations as evidenced by
               this paragraph from a 1968 paper ([3][9]): Denny-Brown and
               Pennebacker ([4][10]) and Norris and Gasteiger ([5][11]) also
               observed orderly recruitment, although they did not carry out a
               statistical analysis of their data. They attributed this
               recruitment to properties of the motor neurons and suggested
               that the larger motor neurons may have higher thresholds and
               innervate larger motor units. Although the evidence to support
               these suggestions was not available, their observations are in
               harmony with ours and their suggested interpretation, in view of
               later developments, is remarkably prescient. Henneman, of
               course, did not give the ``size principle'' its commemorative
               moniker. Nonetheless, he was reproved more than once for not
               giving Denny-Brown more credit in the development of his ideas.
               I know from conversations with Henneman that he regretted having
               done so. 1. [↵][12]1. D. Denny-Brown, 2. J. B. Pennebacker ,

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: People with chronic tetraplegia, due to high-cervical
              spinal cord injury, can regain limb movements through coordinated
              electrical stimulation of peripheral muscles and nerves, known as
              functional electrical stimulation (FES). Users typically command
              FES systems through other preserved, but unrelated and limited in
              number, volitional movements (eg, facial muscle activity, head
              movements, shoulder shrugs). We report the findings of an
              individual with traumatic high-cervical spinal cord injury who
              coordinated reaching and grasping movements using his own
              paralysed arm and hand, reanimated through implanted FES, and
              commanded using his own cortical signals through an intracortical
              brain-computer interface (iBCI). METHODS: We recruited a
              participant into the BrainGate2 clinical trial, an ongoing study
              that obtains safety information regarding an intracortical neural
              interface device, and investigates the feasibility of people with
              tetraplegia controlling assistive devices using their cortical
              signals. Surgical procedures were performed at University
              Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center (Cleveland, OH, USA). Study
              procedures and data analyses were performed at Case Western
              Reserve University (Cleveland, OH, USA) and the US Department of
              Veterans Affairs, Louis Stokes Cleveland Veterans Affairs Medical
              Center (Cleveland, OH, USA). The study participant was a
              53-year-old man with a spinal cord injury (cervical level 4,
              American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale category A).
              He received two intracortical microelectrode arrays in the hand
              area of his motor cortex, and 4 months and 9 months later
              received a total of 36 implanted percutaneous electrodes in his
              right upper and lower arm to electrically stimulate his hand,
              elbow, and shoulder muscles. The participant used a motorised
              mobile arm support for gravitational assistance and to provide
              humeral abduction and adduction under cortical control. We
              assessed the participant's ability to cortically command his
              paralysed arm to perform simple single-joint arm and hand
              movements and functionally meaningful multi-joint movements. We
              compared iBCI control of his paralysed arm with that of a virtual
              three-dimensional arm. This study is registered with
              ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00912041. FINDINGS: The
              intracortical implant occurred on Dec 1, 2014, and we are
              continuing to study the participant. The last session included in
              this report was Nov 7, 2016. The point-to-point target
              acquisition sessions began on Oct 8, 2015 (311 days after
              implant). The participant successfully cortically commanded
              single-joint and coordinated multi-joint arm movements for
              point-to-point target acquisitions (80-100\% accuracy), using
              first a virtual arm and second his own arm animated by FES. Using
              his paralysed arm, the participant volitionally performed
              self-paced reaches to drink a mug of coffee (successfully
              completing 11 of 12 attempts within a single session 463 days
              after implant) and feed himself (717 days after implant).
              INTERPRETATION: To our knowledge, this is the first report of a
              combined implanted FES+iBCI neuroprosthesis for restoring both
              reaching and grasping movements to people with chronic
              tetraplegia due to spinal cord injury, and represents a major
              advance, with a clear translational path, for clinically viable
              neuroprostheses for restoration of reaching and grasping after

  abstract = "Introduction: Asymmetrical sensorimotor function after stroke
              creates unique challenges for bipedal tasks such as walking or
              perturbation-induced reactive stepping. Preference for initiating
              steps with the less-involved (preferred) leg after a perturbation
              has been reported with limited information on the stepping
              response of the more-involved (non-preferred) leg. Understanding
              the capacity of both legs to respond to a perturbation would
              enhance the design of future treatment approaches. This pilot
              study investigated the difference in perturbation-induced
              stepping between legs in stroke participant and non-impaired
              controls. We hypothesized that stepping performance will be
              different between groups as well as between legs for post-stroke
              participants. Methods: Thirty-six participants (20 persons
              post-stroke, 16 age matched controls) were given an anterior
              perturbation from three stance positions: symmetrical (SS),
              preferred asymmetrical (PAS-70\% body weight on the preferred
              leg), and non-preferred asymmetrical (N-PAS-70\% body weight on
              the non-preferred leg). Kinematic and kinetic data were collected
              to measure anticipatory postural adjustment (APA),
              characteristics of the first step (onset, length, height,
              duration), number of steps, and velocity of the body at heel
              strike. Group differences were tested using the Mann-Whitney
              U-test and differences between legs tested using the Wilcoxon
              signed-rank test with an alpha level of 0.05. Results: Stepping
              with the more-involved leg increased from 11.5\% of trials in SS
              and N-PAS up to 46\% in PAS stance position for participants
              post-stroke. Post-stroke participants had an earlier APA and
              always took more steps than controls to regain balance. However,
              differences between post-stroke and control participants were
              mainly found when stance position was modified. Compare to
              controls, steps with the preferred leg (N-PAS) were earlier and
              shorter (in time and length), whereas steps with the
              non-preferred leg (PAS) were also shorter but took longer. For
              post-stroke participants, step duration was longer and utilized
              more steps when stepping with the more-involved leg compared to
              the less-involved leg. Conclusions: Stepping with the
              more-involved leg can be facilitated by unweighting the leg. The
              differences between groups, and legs in post-stroke participants
              illustrate the simultaneous bipedal role (support and stepping)
              both legs have in reactive stepping and should be considered for
              reactive balance training.",

              stroke. Robot-assisted training might improve arm function and
              activities of daily living. We compared the clinical
              effectiveness of robot-assisted training using the MIT-Manus
              robotic gym with an enhanced upper limb therapy (EULT) programme
              based on repetitive functional task practice and with usual care.
              METHODS: RATULS was a pragmatic, multicentre, randomised
              controlled trial done at four UK centres. Stroke patients aged at
              least 18 years with moderate or severe upper limb functional
              limitation, between 1 week and 5 years after their first stroke,
              were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive robot-assisted
              training, EULT, or usual care. Robot-assisted training and EULT
              were provided for 45 min, three times per week for 12 weeks.
              Randomisation was internet-based using permuted block sequences.
              Treatment allocation was masked from outcome assessors but not
              from participants or therapists. The primary outcome was upper
              limb function success (defined using the Action Research Arm Test
              [ARAT]) at 3 months. Analyses were done on an intention-to-treat
              basis. This study is registered with the ISRCTN registry, number
              ISRCTN69371850. FINDINGS: Between April 14, 2014, and April 30,
              2018, 770 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to
              either robot-assisted training (n=257), EULT (n=259), or usual
              care (n=254). The primary outcome of ARAT success was achieved by
              103 (44\%) of 232 patients in the robot-assisted training group,
              118 (50\%) of 234 in the EULT group, and 85 (42\%) of 203 in the
              usual care group. Compared with usual care, robot-assisted
              training (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1·17 [98·3\% CI 0·70-1·96])
              and EULT (aOR 1·51 [0·90-2·51]) did not improve upper limb
              function; the effects of robot-assisted training did not differ
              from EULT (aOR 0·78 [0·48-1·27]). More participants in the
              robot-assisted training group (39 [15\%] of 257) and EULT group
              (33 [13\%] of 259) had serious adverse events than in the usual
              care group (20 [8\%] of 254), but none were attributable to the
              intervention. INTERPRETATION: Robot-assisted training and EULT
              did not improve upper limb function after stroke compared with
              usual care for patients with moderate or severe upper limb
              functional limitation. These results do not support the use of

  abstract = "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Functional electrical stimulation (FES)
              is a popular poststroke gait rehabilitation intervention.
              Although stroke causes multijoint gait deficits, FES is commonly
              used only for the correction of swing-phase foot drop. Ankle
              plantarflexor muscles play an important role during gait. The aim
              of the current study was to test the immediate effects of
              delivering FES to both ankle plantarflexors and dorsiflexors on
              poststroke gait. METHODS: Gait analysis was performed as subjects
              (N=13) with chronic poststroke hemiparesis walked at their
              self-selected walking speeds during walking with and without FES.
              RESULTS: Compared with delivering FES to only the ankle
              dorsiflexor muscles during the swing phase, delivering FES to
              both the paretic ankle plantarflexors during terminal stance and
              dorsiflexors during the swing phase provided the advantage of
              greater swing-phase knee flexion, greater ankle plantarflexion
              angle at toe-off, and greater forward propulsion. Although FES of
              both the dorsiflexor and plantarflexor muscles improved
              swing-phase ankle dorsiflexion compared with noFES, the
              improvement was less than that observed by stimulating the
              dorsiflexors alone, suggesting the need to further optimize
              stimulation parameters and timing for the dorsiflexor muscles
              during gait. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to the typical FES approach
              of stimulating ankle dorsiflexor muscles only during the swing
              phase, delivering FES to both the plantarflexor and dorsiflexor
              muscles can help to correct poststroke gait deficits at multiple

  abstract  = "[This paper reviews some programming techniques in R that have
               proved useful, particularly for substantial projects. These
               include several versions of object-oriented programming, used in
               a large number of R packages. The review tries to clarify the
               origins and ideas behind the various versions, each of which is
               valuable in the appropriate context. R has also been strongly
               influenced by the ideas of functional programming and, in
               particular, by the desire to combine functional with object
               oriented programming. To clarify how this particular mix of
               ideas has turned out in the current R language and supporting
               software, the paper will first review the basic ideas behind
               object-oriented and functional programming, and then examine the
               evolution of R with these ideas providing context. Functional
               programming supports well-defined, defensible software giving
               reproducible results. Object-oriented programming is the
               mechanism par excellence for managing complexity while keeping
               things simple for the user. The two paradigms have been valuable
               in supporting major software for fitting models to data and
               numerous other statistical applications. The paradigms have been
               adopted, and adapted, distinctively in R. Functional programming
               motivates much of R but R does not enforce the paradigm.
               Object-oriented programming from a functional perspective
               differs from that used in non-functional languages, a
               distinction that needs to be emphasized to avoid confusion. R
               initially replicated the S language from Bell Labs, which in
               turn was strongly influenced by earlier program libraries. At
               each stage, new ideas have been added, but the previous software
               continues to show its influence in the design as well. Outlining
               the evolution will further clarify why we currently have this
               somewhat unusual combination of ideas.]",

              kinematics during gait",
  author   = "Langley, Ben and Page, Richard and Greig, Matt",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The pelvis is commonly tracked during
              three-dimensional motion analysis using markers located on the
              anterior and posterior superior iliac spines. However, these
              markers are prone to soft tissue artefact and marker occlusion,
              highlighting the need for alternative technical marker sets.
              RESEARCH QUESTION: How comparable are hip joint kinematics
              calculated using two alternative pelvic technical marker sets and
              a conventionally modelled pelvis? METHODS: Fourteen participants
              undertook 3D gait analysis, walking overground at a self-selected
              pace (1.38 $\pm$ 0.14 m·s-1), barefoot. Hip joint kinematics were
              compared using root mean square error (RMSE) between a
              conventionally tracked pelvis and two alternative technical
              marker sets; (1) posterior cluster and (2) additional iliac crest
              markers. RESULTS: The average RMSE in the sagittal, frontal and
              transverse planes was 2.5° $\pm$ 2.8°, 1.6° $\pm$ 0.4° and 0.8°
              $\pm$ 0.4°, respectively for the posterior cluster, and 1.3°
              $\pm$ 0.7°, 0.8° $\pm$ 0.3° and 1.4° $\pm$ 0.5° for the iliac
              crest marker set. The RMSE was significantly larger for the
              posterior cluster compared to the iliac crest model in the
              sagittal (p = .05, d = .28) and frontal planes (p < .001, d =
              7.65). In contrast, the RMSE was significantly lower for the
              posterior cluster in the transverse plane (p = .01, d = -2.85).
              SIGNIFICANCE: The findings of this study suggest that either a
              posterior cluster or additional iliac crest markers offer means
              of accurately calculating hip joint kinematics within 3° of the
              conventional pelvic model. Therefore, either technical marker set
              offers a viable alternative to the conventional pelvic model for
              calculating hip joint kinematics.",

              Twitchell and Brunnstrom's concept of sequential stages of motor

              well-designed, feasible and efficient clinical examination method
              that has been tested widely in the stroke population. Its primary
              value is the 100-point motor domain, which has received the most
              extensive evaluation. Excellent interrater and intrarater
              reliability and construct validity have been demonstrated, and
              preliminary evidence suggests that the Fugl-Meyer assessment is
              responsive to change. Limitations of the motor domain include a
              ceiling effect, omission of some potentially relevant items, and
              weighting of the arm more than the leg. Further study should test

              demands on caregivers in stroke outcome research. A major aim of
              this study was to identify factors in patients associated with
              emotional distress in caregivers 1 year after stroke. METHODS:
              One-year stroke survivors with residual handicap (defined by the
              Oxford Handicap Scale) and their chief caregivers were
              interviewed as part of the follow-up activities for patients (n =
              492) registered with the Perth Community Stroke Study. We
              assessed emotional distress in caregivers using the Hospital
              Anxiety and Depression Scale and the 28-item General Health
              Questionnaire. Appropriate sections of the Social Behaviour
              Assessment Schedule were used to assess the patient's behavior
              and the impact on the caregiver's life. Other aspects of the
              patient's functional state were assessed with the Barthel Index,
              the Mini-Mental State Examination, the Frenchay Activities Index,
              and the Psychiatric Assessment Schedule (at 4 months after
              stroke). RESULTS: Of 241 patients who survived to 1 year after
              stroke and were living outside of an institution, 103 patients
              (43\%; 95\% confidence interval, 37\% to 49\%) were handicapped.
              Eighty-four patient/caregiver units were assessed from this
              latter group. Almost all caregivers reported adverse effects on
              their emotional health, social activities, and leisure time, and
              more than half reported adverse effects on family relationships.
              Forty-six caregivers (55\%) showed evidence of emotional distress
              on either of the two screening instruments, particularly if they
              were caregiving for patients with dementia and/or abnormal
              behavior. There was no significant relationship between emotional
              illness among caregivers and the degree of patients' physical
              disability. CONCLUSIONS: In this population, the high level of
              emotional distress among caregivers of stroke patients suggests
              that many caregivers have unmet needs. Community services need to
              focus attention on the neuropsychological aspects of stroke

              Reduction in non-affected triceps surae activity can also be
              observed. These may result in a decreased ability to execute
              GI-APA and to generate propulsion forces during step execution. A
              systematic review was conducted to provide an overview of the
              reorganization which occurs in GI-APA following stroke as well as
              of the most effective strategies for tailoring
              gait-rehabilitation to these patients. Sixteen articles were
              included, providing gait data from a total of 220 patients.
              Stroke patients show a decrease in the TA activity associated
              with difficulties in silencing soleus muscle activity of the
              paretic leg, a decreased CoP shift, lower propulsive anterior
              forces and a longer preparatory phase. Regarding possible
              gait-rehabilitation strategies, the selected studies show that
              initiating gait with the paretic leg provides poor balance. The
              use of the non-paretic as the leading leg can be a useful
              exercise to stimulate the paretic postural muscles.",

              presence of specialized CPGs in human locomotion is still a
              matter of debate. An interesting numerical model developed in the
              90s' demonstrated the important role CPGs could play in human
              locomotion, both in terms of stability against perturbations, and
              in terms of speed control. Recently, a reflex-based
              neuro-musculo-skeletal model has been proposed, showing a level
              of stability to perturbations similar to the previous model,
              without any CPG components. Although exhibiting striking
              similarities with human gaits, the lack of CPG makes the control
              of speed/step length in the model difficult. In this paper, we

              controlling the locomotion speed. After introducing the CPG
              component in the reflex model, and taking advantage of the
              resulting properties, a simple model for gait modulation is
              presented. The results highlight the advantages of a CPG as

              update the most current incidence and mortality data on stroke
              available by country, and to expand the scope to case-fatality
              and explore how registry data might be complementary. Methods
              Data were compiled using two approaches: (1) an updated
              literature review building from our previous review and (2)
              direct acquisition and analysis of stroke events in the World
              Health Organization (WHO) mortality database for each country
              providing these data. To assess new and/or updated data on
              incidence, we searched multiple databases to identify new
              original papers and review articles that met ideal criteria for
              stroke incidence studies and were published between 15 May 2013
              and 31 May 2016. For data on case-fatality, we searched between
              1980 and 31 May 2016. We further screened reference lists and
              citation history of papers to identify other studies not obtained
              from these sources. Mortality codes for ICD-8, ICD-9, and ICD-10
              were extracted. Using population denominators provided for each
              country, we calculated both the crude mortality from stroke and
              mortality adjusted to the WHO world population. We used only the
              most recent year reported to the WHO for which both population
              and mortality data were available. Results Fifty-one countries
              had data on stroke incidence, some with data over many time
              periods, and some with data in more than one region. Since our
              last review, there were new incidence studies from 12 countries,
              with four meeting pre-determined quality criteria. In these four
              studies, the incidence of stroke, adjusted to the WHO World
              standard population, ranged from 76 per 100,000 population per
              year in Australia (2009-10) up to 119 per 100,000 population per
              year in New Zealand (2011-12), with the latter being in those
              aged at least 15 years. Only in Martinique (2011-12) was the
              incidence of stroke greater in women than men. In countries
              either lacking or with old data on stroke incidence, eight had
              national clinical registries of hospital based data. Of the 128
              countries reporting mortality data to the WHO, crude mortality
              was greatest in Kazhakstan (in 2003), Bulgaria, and Greece. Crude
              mortality and crude incidence of stroke were both positively
              correlated with the proportion of the population aged $\geq$ 65
              years, but not with time. Data on case-fatality were available in
              42 studies in 22 countries, with large variations between
              regions. Conclusions In this updated review, we describe the
              current data on stroke incidence, case-fatality and mortality in
              different countries, and highlight the growing trend for national
              clinical registries to provide estimates in lieu of

  abstract = "Walking dysfunction occurs at a very high prevalence in stroke
              survivors. Human walking is a phenomenon often taken for granted,
              but it is mediated by complicated neural control mechanisms. The
              automatic process includes the brainstem descending pathways (RST
              and VST) and the intraspinal locomotor network. It is known that
              leg muscles are organized into modules to serve subtasks for body
              support, posture and locomotion. Major kinematic mechanisms are
              recognized to minimize the center of gravity (COG) displacement.
              Stroke leads to damage to motor cortices and their descending
              corticospinal tracts and subsequent muscle weakness. On the other
              hand, brainstem descending pathways and the intraspinal motor
              network are disinhibited and become hyperexcitable. Recent
              advances suggest that they mediate post-stroke spasticity and
              diffuse spastic synergistic activation. As a result of such
              changes, existing modules are simplified and merged, thus leading
              to poor body support and walking performance. The wide range and
              hierarchy of post-stroke hemiplegic gait impairments is a
              reflection of mechanical consequences of muscle weakness,
              spasticity, abnormal synergistic activation and their
              interactions. Given the role of brainstem descending pathways in
              body support and locomotion and post-stroke spasticity, a new
              perspective of understanding post-stroke hemiplegic gait is
              proposed. Its clinical implications for management of hemiplegic
              gait are discussed. Two cases are presented as clinical

              controlling the upper and lower regions of the trunk on reaching
              provides insight into the mechanisms by which trunk control
              impacts reaching in infants. Ten healthy infants were recruited
              at 2.5 months of age and tested longitudinally, until 8 months.
              During the reaching test, infants were placed in an upright
              seated position and an adjustable support device provided trunk
              fixation at pelvic and thoracic levels. Kinematic and
              electromyographic data were collected. Results showed that prior
              to independent sitting, postural instability was higher when
              infants were provided with pelvic compared to thoracic support.
              Associated reaches were more circuitous, less smooth and less
              efficient. In response to the instability, there was increased
              postural muscle activity and arm muscle co-activation.
              Differences between levels of support were not observed once
              infants acquired independent sitting. These results suggest that
              trunk control is acquired in a segmental sequence across the
              development of upright sitting, and it is tightly correlated with
              reaching performance.",

              traumatic and nontraumatic etiology. METHODS: A total of 80
              participants from 3 to 6 months after onset admitted to 1 site
              for rehabilitation were included in a single-blind randomized
              clinical trial of 2 parallel groups, with blind evaluation by
              independent observers. Patients received 40 walking reeducation
              sessions of equal time using a Lokomat program with overground
              practice or overground mobility therapy alone. Primary
              measurements of outcome were walking speed and the Walking Index

              6-minute walk test, locomotor section of the Functional
              Independence Measure, Lower Extremity Motor Score (LEMS),
              Ashworth Scale, and Visual Analog Scale for pain. RESULTS: No

              body-weight-supported treadmill training (BWSTT) and
              robotic-assisted gait training with overground gait training and
              other forms of physiotherapy in people with traumatic SCI.
              SETTING: Systematic review conducted by researchers from Germany
              and Australia. METHODS: An extensive search was conducted for
              randomised controlled trials involving people with traumatic SCI
              that compared either BWSTT or robotic-assisted gait training with
              overground gait training and other forms of physiotherapy. The
              two outcomes of interest were walking speed (m s-1) and walking
              distance (m). BWSTT and robotic-assisted gait training were
              analysed separately, and data were pooled across trials to derive
              mean between-group differences using a random-effects model.
              RESULTS: Thirteen randomised controlled trials involving 586
              people were identified. Ten trials involving 462 participants
              compared BWSTT to overground gait training and other forms of

              pooled mean (95\% confidence interval (CI)) between-group
              differences for walking speed and walking distance were -0.03 m
              s-1 (-0.10 to 0.04) and -7 m (-45 to 31), respectively, favouring

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: A contralateral pelvic drop, a transverse rotation
              and a lateral translation of the pelvis are essential features of
              normal human gait. These motions are often restricted in
              robot-assisted gait devices. The optional FreeD module of the
              driven gait orthosis Lokomat (Hocoma AG, Switzerland)
              incorporates guided lateral translation and transverse rotation
              of the pelvis. It consequently should support weight shifting
              during walking. This study aimed to investigate the influence of
              the FreeD module on trunk kinematics and hip and trunk muscle
              activity. METHODS: Thirty- one healthy adults participated. A
              video analysis of their trunk movements was performed to
              investigate the lateral chest and pelvis displacement within the
              Lokomat (with and without FreeD), and this was compared to
              treadmill walking. Furthermore, surface electromyography (sEMG)
              signals from eight muscles were collected during walking in the
              Lokomat (with and without FreeD), on the treadmill, and
              overground. To compare the similarity of the sEMG patterns,
              Spearman's correlation analyses were applied. RESULTS: Walking
              with FreeD elicited a significantly higher lateral pelvis
              displacement and a lower lateral chest displacement (relative to
              the pelvis) compared to walking with a fixated pelvis. No
              significant differences in the sEMG patterns were found for the
              Lokomat conditions (with and without FreeD) when comparing it to
              treadmill or overground walking. CONCLUSIONS: The differences in
              pelvis displacement act as a proof of concept of the FreeD
              module. The reduction of relative lateral chest movement
              corresponds to a decrease in compensatory trunk movements and has
              its origin in allowing weight shifting through the FreeD module.
              Both Lokomat conditions showed very similar muscle activity
              patterns of the trunk and hip compared to overground and
              treadmill walking. This indicates that the Lokomat allows a
              physiological muscle activity of the trunk and hip during gait.",

              devices are used in rehabilitation and might help to improve
              walking after stroke. This is an update of a Cochrane Review
              first published in 2007. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects
              of automated electromechanical- and robotic-assisted
              gait-training devices for improving walking after stroke. SEARCH
              METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register
              (last searched 9 August 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of
              Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library 2016, Issue 8),
              MEDLINE in Ovid (1950 to 15 August 2016), Embase (1980 to 15
              August 2016), CINAHL (1982 to 15 August 2016), AMED (1985 to 15
              August 2016), Web of Science (1899 to 16 August 2016),
              SPORTDiscus (1949 to 15 September 2012), the Physiotherapy
              Evidence Database (PEDro) (searched 16 August 2016), and the
              engineering databases COMPENDEX (1972 to 16 November 2012) and
              Inspec (1969 to 26 August 2016). We handsearched relevant
              conference proceedings, searched trials and research registers,
              checked reference lists, and contacted authors in an effort to
              identify further published, unpublished, and ongoing trials.
              SELECTION CRITERIA: We included all randomised controlled trials
              and randomised controlled cross-over trials in people over the
              age of 18 years diagnosed with stroke of any severity, at any
              stage, in any setting, evaluating electromechanical- and
              robotic-assisted gait training versus normal care. DATA
              COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently
              selected trials for inclusion, assessed methodological quality
              and risk of bias, and extracted the data. The primary outcome was
              the proportion of participants walking independently at
              follow-up. MAIN RESULTS: We included 36 trials involving 1472
              participants in this review update. Electromechanical-assisted
              gait training in combination with physiotherapy increased the
              odds of participants becoming independent in walking (odds ratio
              (random effects) 1.94, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.39 to
              2.71; P < 0.001; I² = 8\%; moderate-quality evidence) but did not
              significantly increase walking velocity (mean difference (MD)
              0.04 m/s, 95\% CI 0.00 to 0.09; P = 0.08; I² = 65\%; low-quality
              evidence) or walking capacity (MD 5.84 metres walked in 6
              minutes, 95\% CI -16.73 to 28.40; P = 0.61; I² = 53\%; very
              low-quality evidence). The results must be interpreted with
              caution because 1) some trials investigated people who were
              independent in walking at the start of the study, 2) we found
              variations between the trials with respect to devices used and
              duration and frequency of treatment, and 3) some trials included
              devices with functional electrical stimulation. Our planned
              subgroup analysis suggested that people in the acute phase may
              benefit, but people in the chronic phase may not benefit from
              electromechanical-assisted gait training. Post hoc analysis
              showed that people who are non-ambulatory at intervention onset
              may benefit, but ambulatory people may not benefit from this type
              of training. Post hoc analysis showed no differences between the
              types of devices used in studies regarding ability to walk, but
              significant differences were found between devices in terms of
              walking velocity. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: People who receive
              electromechanical-assisted gait training in combination with
              physiotherapy after stroke are more likely to achieve independent
              walking than people who receive gait training without these
              devices. We concluded that seven patients need to be treated to
              prevent one dependency in walking. Specifically, people in the
              first three months after stroke and those who are not able to
              walk seem to benefit most from this type of intervention. The
              role of the type of device is still not clear. Further research
              should consist of large definitive pragmatic phase III trials
              undertaken to address specific questions about the most effective
              frequency and duration of electromechanical-assisted gait
              training as well as how long any benefit may last.",

              Included studies were randomized/quasi-randomized trials in
              adults after stroke where an active motor sequence aiming to
              improve functional activity was performed repetitively within a

              resources, and software. RESULTS: We included 14 trials with 17
              intervention-control pairs and 659 participants. Results were
              statistically significant for walking distance (mean difference
              54.6, 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI) 17.5, 91.7); walking
              speed (standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.29, 95\% CI 0.04,

              walking ability (SMD 0.25, 95\% CI 0.00, 0.51), and global motor
              function (SMD 0.32, 95\% CI -0.01, 0.66). There were no

              activity, lower limb functional activity scales, or
              sitting/standing balance/reach. CONCLUSION: Repetitive task
              training resulted in modest improvement across a range of lower
              limb outcome measures, but not upper limb outcome measures.
              Training may be sufficient to have a small impact on activities
              of daily living. Interventions involving elements of repetition
              and task training are diverse and difficult to classify: the
              results presented are specific to trials where both elements are

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Previous data suggest that the amount and aerobic
              intensity of stepping training may improve walking poststroke.
              Recent animal and human studies suggest that training in
              challenging and variable contexts can also improve locomotor
              function. Such practice may elicit substantial stepping errors,
              although alterations in locomotor strategies to correct these
              errors could lead to improved walking ability. OBJECTIVE: This
              unblinded pilot study was designed to evaluate the feasibility
              and preliminary efficacy of providing stepping practice in
              variable, challenging contexts (tasks and environments) at high
              aerobic intensities in participants >6 months and 1-6 months
              post-stroke. METHODS: A total of 25 participants (gait speeds
              <0.9 m/s with no more than moderate assistance) participated in
              $\leq$40 training sessions (duration of 1 hour) within 10 weeks.
              Stepping training in variable, challenging contexts was performed
              at 70\% to 80\% heart rate reserve, with feasibility measures of
              total steps/session, ability to achieve targeted intensities,
              patient tolerance, dropouts, and adverse events. Gait speed,
              symmetry, and 6-minute walk were measured every 4 to 5 weeks or
              20 sessions, with a 3-month follow-up (F/U). RESULTS: In all, 22
              participants completed $\geq$4 training weeks, averaging 2887
              $\pm$ 780 steps/session over 36 $\pm$ 5.8 sessions. Self-selected

  abstract = "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Prescribing the most appropriate dose of motor
              therapy for individual patients is a challenge because minimal
              data are available and a large number of factors are unknown.
              This review explores the concept of dose and reviews the most
              recent findings in the field of neurorehabilitation, with a focus
              on relearning motor skills after stroke. RECENT FINDINGS:
              Appropriate dosing involves the prescription of a specific amount
              of an active ingredient, at a specific frequency and duration.
              Dosing parameters, particularly amount, are not well defined or
              quantified in most studies. Compiling data across studies
              indicates a positive, moderate dose-response relationship,
              indicating that more movement practice results in better
              outcomes. This relationship is confounded by time after stroke,
              however, wherein longer durations of scheduled therapy may not be
              beneficial in the first few hours, days, and/or weeks. SUMMARY:
              These findings suggest that substantially more movement practice
              may be necessary to achieve better outcomes for people living
              with the disabling consequences of stroke. Preclinical
              investigations are needed to elucidate many of the unknowns and
              allow for a more biologically driven rehabilitation prescription
              process. Likewise, clinical investigations are needed to
              determine the dose-response relationships and examine the
              potential dose-timing interaction in humans.",

              allocated to group. INTERVENTIONS: All subjects received
              twenty-four 1-hour sessions over 2 months. Subjects in the robot
              group practiced shoulder and elbow movements while assisted by a
              robot manipulator. Subjects in the control group received

  abstract = "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Stroke rehabilitation assumes motor
              learning contributes to motor recovery, yet motor learning in
              stroke has received little systematic investigation. Here we
              aimed to illustrate that despite matching levels of performance
              on a task, a trained patient should not be considered equal to an
              untrained patient with less impairment. METHODS: We examined
              motor learning in healthy control participants and groups of
              stroke survivors with mild-to-moderate or moderate-to-severe
              motor impairment. Participants performed a series of isometric
              contractions of the elbow flexors to navigate an on-screen cursor
              to different targets, and trained to perform this task over a
              4-day period. The speed-accuracy trade-off function (SAF) was
              assessed for each group, controlling for differences in
              self-selected movement speeds between individuals. RESULTS: The
              initial SAF for each group was proportional to their impairment.
              All groups were able to improve their performance through skill
              acquisition. Interestingly, training led the moderate-to-severe
              group to match the untrained (baseline) performance of the
              mild-to-moderate group, while the trained mild-to-moderate group
              matched the untrained (baseline) performance of the controls.
              Critically, this did not make the two groups equivalent; they
              differed in their capacity to improve beyond this matched
              performance level. Specifically, the trained groups had reached a
              plateau, while the untrained groups had not. CONCLUSIONS: Despite
              matching levels of performance on a task, a trained patient is
              not equal to an untrained patient with less impairment. This has
              important implications for decisions both on the focus of

              design with two retention trials. SETTING: Outpatient

              chronic hemiparesis secondary to a single unilateral cerebral
              stroke without evidence of severe cognitive or language
              impairment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The primary hypothesis was that
              hemiparetic motor learning that occurred under conditions of
              contextual interference (ie, random practice) would be retained
              better than learning that occurred under conditions of repetitive

              found among the three groups (ie, random-practice,
              blocked-practice, control) on both the first retention measure
              (chi 2 = 13.50, p < .01) and the second retention measure (chi 2

  abstract = "Background and Purpose- The amount of task-specific stepping
              practice provided during rehabilitation poststroke can influence
              locomotor recovery and reflects one aspect of exercise dose that
              can affect the efficacy of specific interventions. Emerging data
              suggest that markedly increasing the intensity and variability of
              stepping practice may also be critical, although such strategies
              are discouraged during traditional rehabilitation. The goal of
              this study was to determine the individual and combined
              contributions of intensity and variability of stepping practice
              to improving walking speed and distance in individuals
              poststroke. Methods- This phase 2, randomized, blinded assessor
              clinical trial was performed between May 2015 and November 2018.
              Individuals between 18 and 85 years old with hemiparesis
              poststroke of >6 months duration were recruited. Of the 152
              individuals screened, 97 were randomly assigned to 1 of 3
              training groups, with 90 completing >10 sessions. Interventions
              consisted of either high-intensity stepping (70\%-80\% heart rate
              reserve) of variable, difficult stepping tasks (high variable),
              high-intensity stepping performing only forward walking (high
              forward), and low-intensity stepping in variable contexts at 30\%
              to 40\% heart rate reserve (low variable). Participants received
              up to 30 sessions over 2 months, with testing at baseline,
              post-training, and a 3-month follow-up. Primary outcomes included
              walking speeds and timed distance, with secondary measures of
              dynamic balance, transfers, spatiotemporal kinematics, and
              metabolic measures. Results- All walking gains were significantly
              greater following either high-intensity group versus low-variable
              training (all P<0.001) with significant correlations with
              stepping amount and rate (r=0.48-60; P<0.01). Additional gains in
              spatiotemporal symmetry were observed with high-intensity
              training, and balance confidence increased only following
              high-variable training in individuals with severe impairments.
              Conclusions- High-intensity stepping training resulted in greater
              improvements in walking ability and gait symmetry than
              low-intensity training in individuals with chronic stroke, with
              potential greater improvements in balance confidence. Clinical

              movement practice occurred during stroke rehabilitation, and what
              factors might influence doses of practice provided. DESIGN:
              Observational survey of stroke therapy sessions. SETTING: Seven
              inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation sites. PARTICIPANTS: We
              observed a convenience sample of 312 physical and occupational
              therapy sessions for people with stroke. INTERVENTIONS: Not
              applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We recorded numbers of
              repetitions in specific movement categories and data on potential
              modifying factors (patient age, side affected, time since stroke,
              FIM item scores, years of therapist experience). Descriptive
              statistics were used to characterize amounts of practice.
              Correlation and regression analyses were used to determine
              whether potential factors were related to the amount of practice
              in the 2 important categories of upper extremity functional
              movements and gait steps. RESULTS: Practice of task-specific,
              functional upper extremity movements occurred in 51\% of the
              sessions that addressed upper limb rehabilitation, and the
              average number of repetitions/session was 32 (95\% confidence
              interval [CI]=20-44). Practice of gait occurred in 84\% of
              sessions that addressed lower limb rehabilitation and the average
              number of gait steps/session was 357 (95\% CI=296-418). None of
              the potential factors listed accounted for significant variance
              in the amount of practice in either of these 2 categories.
              CONCLUSIONS: The amount of practice provided during poststroke
              rehabilitation is small compared with animal models. It is
              possible that current doses of task-specific practice during
              rehabilitation are not adequate to drive the neural
              reorganization needed to promote function poststroke optimally.",

               and dexterity of the paretic arm, in a single-blind randomised
               controlled trial. METHODS: Within 14 days after stroke onset,
               101 severely disabled patients with a primary
               middle-cerebral-artery stroke were randomly assigned to: a
               rehabilitation programme with emphasis on arm training; a
               rehabilitation programme with emphasis on leg training; or a
               control programme in which the arm and leg were immobilised with
               an inflatable pressure splint. Each treatment regimen was
               applied for 30 min, 5 days a week during the first 20 weeks
               after stroke. In addition, all patients underwent a basic
               rehabilitation programme. The main outcome measures were ability
               in ADL (Barthel index), walking ability (functional ambulation
               categories), and dexterity of the paretic arm (Action Research
               arm test) at 6, 12, 20, and 26 weeks. Analyses were by intention
               to treat. FINDINGS: At week 20, the leg-training group (n=31)
               had higher scores than the control group (n=37) for ADL ability
               (median 19 [IQR 16-20] vs 16 [10-19], p<0.05), walking ability
               (4 [3-5] vs 3 [1-4], p<0.05), and dexterity (2 [0-56] vs 0
               [0-2], p<0.01). The arm-training group (n=33) differed
               significantly from the control group only in dexterity (9 [0-39]

              treatment sessions for people with hemiparesis post-stroke. We
              observed 36 treatment sessions and recorded the types of
              activities and the number of repetitions of each activity that
              were done. Observations were categorized and descriptive
              statistics were generated for each category and subcategory. Our
              results showed that treatment time averaged 36 minutes per
              session. In sessions addressing the upper extremity, the average
              number of repetitions per session were 39 for active-exercise
              movements, 34 for passive-exercise movements, and 12 for
              purposeful movements. In sessions addressing the lower extremity,
              the average number of repetitions per session were 33 for
              active-exercise movements, six for passive-exercise movements,
              and eight for purposeful movements. In sessions addressing gait,
              the average number of steps taken was 292. In sessions addressing
              transfers, the average number of repetitions per session was 11.
              For most categories, there was considerable variability in the
              number of repetitions observed. We conclude that the numbers of
              repetitions observed during PT and OT for people with hemiparesis
              post-stroke are relatively small, except for gait steps. The fact
              that the number of repetitions of upper extremity purposeful
              movements was smaller than the number of repetitions of upper
              extremity active- and passive-exercise movements was surprising.
              This finding is inconsistent with current teaching that practice
              of purposeful movements is an integral part of improving
              functional status.",

              anticipatory postural adjustment in axial and lateral, posterior
              and anterior trunk muscles during the performance of upper-and
              lower-limb flexion tasks, in subjects with hemiparesis after

              nonrandomized control study. SETTING: Geriatric rehabilitation
              center in Israel. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty poststroke hemiparetic
              patients and 30 healthy control subjects. INTERVENTION:
              Electromyographic activity of the lumbar erector spinae and of
              the latissimus dorsi muscles was recorded bilaterally during
              flexion of either arm and from the 2 rectus abdominis and
              obliquus externus muscles during flexion of either hip. MAIN
              OUTCOME MEASURES: Muscles' onset latency, cross-correlation
              values between the temporal activation profile of corresponding
              pairs and between ipsilateral muscular pairs, symmetry in
              activation magnitude of corresponding muscles, and relation
              between electromyographic activity and motor and functional
              performance RESULTS: Onset latencies of trunk muscles were
              partially delayed in the patients with longest hindrance
              displayed by the erector spinae ipsilateral to the flexing arm
              (P<.04). Temporal synchronization between pertinent muscular
              pairs was lower in the patients than in the healthy subjects,
              with significant group differences (P<.05 or lower) in the
              correlations between ipsilateral pairs of trunk muscles.
              Activation of the corresponding lateral trunk muscles in the
              patients was significantly less symmetrical than in the controls
              (P<.03 or lower) because of reduced activity on the paretic body
              side, especially on flexing of the paretic limbs. Conversely, in
              the controls as well as on the nonparetic side of the patients,
              limb flexion was associated with increased activity in the
              ipsilateral lateral trunk muscle. The erector spinae muscle in
              both groups and on both sides was more active on the
              contralateral side than on the ipsilateral side to the flexing
              arm. The reduced activity level in trunk muscles on the paretic
              body side was associated with deficiencies in motor and
              functional abilities. CONCLUSIONS: Major impairments in the
              activity of trunk muscles in hemiparetic subjects were manifested
              in the reduced activity level of the lateral trunk muscles, in
              delayed onset, and in reduced synchronization between activation
              of pertinent muscular pairs. These problems were associated with
              motor and functional deficits and warrant specific consideration

              Fifteen stroke patients and 15 age- and gender-matched healthy
              subjects participated. Each subject performed flexion of the hip
              and shoulder of the non-paretic or matched side as fast as
              possible, as well as trunk flexion and extension at a
              self-selected speed. A Qualisys motion system was employed to
              track the kinematics of the trunk and limbs. [Results] Patients
              presented larger mediolateral displacement of the center of mass
              during all limb and trunk movements, and larger velocity of
              center of mass during hip flexion movement. Healthy subjects

              January 2011 to December 2016. The main inclusion criteria were:
              patients with modified or abnormal gait; application of
              technology-based feedback to deal with functional recovery of
              gait; any comparison between different kinds of feedback applied
              by means of technology, or any comparison between technological
              and non-technological feedback; and randomized controlled trials.
              Twenty papers were included. The populations were neurological
              patients (75\%), orthopedic and healthy subjects. All
              participants were adults, bar one. Four studies used
              exoskeletons, 6 load platforms and 5 pressure sensors. The
              breakdown of the type of feedback used was as follows: 60\%
              visual, 40\% acoustic and 15\% haptic. 55\% used terminal
              feedback versus 65\% simultaneous feedback. Prescriptive feedback
              was used in 60\% of cases, while 50\% used descriptive feedback.
              62.5\% and 58.33\% of the trials showed a significant effect in
              improving step length and speed, respectively. Efficacy in

              mostly effective in improving gait parameters and therefore
              useful for the functional recovery of patients. The most

              ice-skating, we can rapidly generalize to novel tasks, such as
              motorcycling or rollerblading [1-8]. Such facilitation of
              learning could arise through two distinct mechanisms by which the
              motor system might adjust its control parameters. First, fast
              learning could simply be a consequence of the proximity of the
              original and final settings of the control parameters. Second, by
              structural learning [9-14], the motor system could constrain the
              parameter adjustments to conform to the control parameters'
              covariance structure. Thus, facilitation of learning would rely
              on the novel task parameters' lying on the structure of a

              randomly varying visuomotor tasks of fixed structure. Although
              such randomly varying tasks are thought to prevent learning, we
              show that when subsequently presented with novel tasks, subjects
              exhibit three key features of structural learning: facilitated
              learning of tasks with the same structure, strong reduction in
              interference normally observed when switching between tasks that
              require opposite control strategies, and preferential exploration
              along the learned structure. These results suggest that skill
              generalization relies on task variation and structural learning.",

               transfer of movement control in motor skill learning. For any
               examination of human learning, and of the aspects of learning
               concerned with transfer, is the area of skilled motor behavior
               and its acquisition. It is difficult to provide a simple
               distinction between those aspects of human functioning that are
               termed as motor and nonmotor, and yet these divisions of human
               responding are generally understood. The difficulty is that, on
               the one hand, every motor response has a perceptual--cognitive
               component and requires at least minimal decision making. On the
               other hand, even the most cognitive of tasks involves a movement
               of some sort in order that the subject conveys a response to the
               experimenter. The focus on motor behavior emphasizes the way a
               performer controls his or her limbs in ways that is skilled,
               where the precise patterning and timing of muscle forces are the
               primary determinants of success, and where decisions and the
               choice among movement patterns of activity are minimized. Thus,
               motor behavior involves situations in which the learner's
               problem is to determine the way to do it rather than determining
               what to do.",

              evolution of behaviour and neural circuits. Over the course of
              evolutionary history, gradual evolution of behaviours and their
              neural circuitry within any lineage of animals has been a
              predominant occurrence. Small changes in gene regulation can lead
              to divergence of circuit organization and corresponding changes
              in behaviour. However, some behavioural divergence has resulted
              from large-scale rewiring of the neural network. Divergence of
              CPG circuits has also occurred without a corresponding change in
              behaviour. When analogous rhythmic behaviours have evolved
              independently, it has generally been with different neural
              mechanisms. Repeated evolution of particular rhythmic behaviours
              has occurred within some lineages due to parallel evolution or
              latent CPGs. Particular motor pattern generating mechanisms have
              also evolved independently in separate lineages. The evolution of
              CPGs and rhythmic behaviours shows that although most behaviours

              behaviour does not dictate the neural mechanism and that the
              presence of homologous neural components does not determine the

              rolling, a key motor skill. However, little is known regarding
              limb coordination and postural control in infant rolling. To
              address this lack of knowledge, we examined movement patterns and
              limb coordination during rolling in younger infants (aged 5-7
              months) that had just begun to roll and in older infants (aged
              8-10 months) with greater rolling experience. Due to anticipated
              difficulty in obtaining measurements over the second half of the
              rolling sequence, we limited our analysis to the first half.
              Ipsilateral and contralateral limbs were identified on the basis
              of rolling direction and were classified as either a stationary
              limb used for postural stability or a moving limb used for
              controlled movement. We classified the observed movement patterns
              by identifying the number of stationary limbs and the serial
              order of combinational limb movement patterns. Notably, older
              infants performed more movement patterns that involved a lower
              number of stationary limbs than younger infants. Despite the wide
              range of possible movement patterns, a small group of basic
              patterns dominated in both age groups. Our results suggest that
              the fundamental structure of limb coordination during rolling in
              the early acquisition stages remains unchanged until at least
              8-10 months of age. However, compared to younger infants, older
              infants exhibited a greater ability to select an effective

              stroke rehabilitation interventions in the domain of PT. METHODS
              AND FINDINGS: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) regarding PT in
              stroke rehabilitation were retrieved through a systematic search.
              Outcomes were classified according to the ICF. RCTs with a low
              risk of bias were quantitatively analyzed. Differences between
              phases poststroke were explored in subgroup analyses. A best
              evidence synthesis was performed for neurological treatment
              approaches. The search yielded 467 RCTs (N = 25373; median PEDro
              score 6 [IQR 5-7]), identifying 53 interventions. No adverse
              events were reported. Strong evidence was found for significant
              positive effects of 13 interventions related to gait, 11
              interventions related to arm-hand activities, 1 intervention for
              ADL, and 3 interventions for physical fitness. Summary Effect
              Sizes (SESs) ranged from 0.17 (95\%CI 0.03-0.70; I(2) = 0\%) for
              therapeutic positioning of the paretic arm to 2.47 (95\%CI
              0.84-4.11; I(2) = 77\%) for training of sitting balance. There is
              strong evidence that a higher dose of practice is better, with
              SESs ranging from 0.21 (95\%CI 0.02-0.39; I(2) = 6\%) for motor
              function of the paretic arm to 0.61 (95\%CI 0.41-0.82; I(2) =
              41\%) for muscle strength of the paretic leg. Subgroup analyses
              yielded significant differences with respect to timing poststroke
              for 10 interventions. Neurological treatment approaches to
              training of body functions and activities showed equal or
              unfavorable effects when compared to other training
              interventions. Main limitations of the present review are not

              poststroke. Effects are mostly restricted to the actually trained

              corresponding to Brunnstrom stages 3-4. Trunk functional
              performance was measured using bed mobility monitor system. All

              displacement of center of pressure (CoP) from supine to side

              the paretic side toward the nonparetic side compared to the other
              direction, with an estimated mean difference of 0.427 sec (P =

              of CoP in rolling back from side lying on the nonparetic side was
              smaller than that from the paretic side with an estimated mean
              difference of -0.797 cm (P = 0.023). CONCLUSIONS: The impaired

              a coordinated manner to move from one posture to another. Rolling
              is accomplished from prone to supine and supine to prone,

              purpose of this case report is to describe the use of MI practice
              to attempt to improve walking in an individual with hemiparesis.
              CASE DESCRIPTION: A 69-year-old man with left hemiparesis
              received MI gait practice for 6 weeks. Intervention focused on
              task-oriented gait and on impairments of the affected lower limb.
              Preintervention, midterm, postintervention, and follow-up
              measurements of temporal-distance stride parameters and sagittal
              kinematics of the knee joint were taken. MAIN OUTCOMES: At 6
              weeks postintervention, the patient had a 23\% increase in gait
              speed and a 13\% reduction in double-support time. An increase in
              range of motion of the knees also was observed. No changes in

              temporal-distance gait variables and knee movement, imagery

              volunteers with hemiparesis caused by a unilateral stroke that
              occurred at least 3 months before the study. INTERVENTION:
              Participants received 15 minutes of supervised imagery gait
              training in their homes 3 days a week for 6 weeks. The
              intervention addressed gait impairments of the affected lower
              limb and task-specific gait training. Walking ability was
              evaluated by kinematics and functional scales twice before the
              intervention, 3 and 6 weeks after the intervention began, and at
              the 3-week follow-up. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Spatiotemporal,
              kinematic, and functional walking measurements. RESULTS: Walking
              speed increased significantly by 40\% after training, and the
              gains were largely maintained at the 3-week follow-up. The effect

              generator (CPG), which is an intraspinal network of neurons
              capable of generating a rhythmic output. The spatio-temporal
              symmetries of the quadrupedal gaits walk, trot and pace lead to
              plausible assumptions about the symmetries of locomotor CPGs.
              These assumptions imply that the CPG of a quadruped should
              consist of eight nominally identical subcircuits, arranged in an
              essentially unique matter. Here we apply analogous arguments to
              myriapod CPGs. Analyses based on symmetry applied to these
              networks lead to testable predictions, including a distinction
              between primary and secondary gaits, the existence of a new
              primary gait called 'jump', and the occurrence of half-integer
              wave numbers in myriapod gaits. For bipeds, our analysis also
              predicts two gaits with the out-of-phase symmetry of the walk and
              two gaits with the in-phase symmetry of the hop. We present data
              that support each of these predictions. This work suggests that
              symmetry can be used to infer a plausible class of CPG network

              under specific experimental conditions in reduced animal

              debate. Equally elusive is the contribution of CPGs to normal
              bipedal locomotion. To address these points, we focus on human
              studies that utilized spinal cord stimulation or pharmacological
              neuromodulation to generate rhythmic activity in individuals with
              spinal cord injury, and on neuromechanical modeling of human

              step-specific sensory feedback, the human lumbar spinal cord can
              produce rhythmic muscle activation patterns that closely resemble
              CPG-induced neural activity of the isolated animal spinal cord.
              In this sense, CPGs in humans can be defined by the activity they
              produce. During normal locomotion, CPGs could contribute to the
              activation patterns during specific phases of the step cycle and

              to do body weight supported treadmill training with visual
              biofeedback (BB group) or BWS treadmill training without visual
              biofeedback. Their gait was assessed with a 3D system
              (spatiotemporal gait parameters and symmetry index) and by means
              of 2-minute walk test (2 MWT), 10-metre walk test (10 MWT), and
              Timed Up \& Go test. Subjects in both groups participated in 15

              significant improvement in spatiotemporal gait parameters,
              walking speed, endurance, and mobility. The average change in the

              change in the symmetry index value of stance phase in the BB
              group was 0.03 (0.02) and in the control group was 0.02 (0.02).

              assistive robotics and training protocols have primarily focused
              on guiding leg movements to reinforce sensory feedback. Despite
              the importance of trunk postural dynamics on gait and balance,
              trunk assistance has comparatively received little attention.
              Typically, trunk movements are either constrained within
              bodyweight support systems, or manually adjusted by therapists.
              Here, we show that real-time control of trunk posture
              re-established dynamic balance amongst bilateral proprioceptive
              feedback circuits, and thereby restored left-right symmetry,
              loading and stepping consistency in rats with severe SCI. We
              developed a robotic system that adjusts mediolateral trunk

              relationships between trunk orientation and the modulation of

              VJ (1973) Science 179:186-187], we find that bipedal and
              quadrupedal walking costs are not significantly different in our
              sample of adult chimpanzees. However, a more detailed analysis
              reveals significant differences in bipedal and quadrupedal cost
              in most individuals, which are masked when subjects are examined
              as a group. Furthermore, human walking is approximately 75\% less
              costly than both quadrupedal and bipedal walking in chimpanzees.
              Variation in cost between bipedal and quadrupedal walking, as
              well as between chimpanzees and humans, is well explained by
              biomechanical differences in anatomy and gait, with the decreased
              cost of human walking attributable to our more extended hip and a
              longer hindlimb. Analyses of these features in early fossil
              hominins, coupled with analyses of bipedal walking in
              chimpanzees, indicate that bipedalism in early, ape-like hominins
              could indeed have been less costly than quadrupedal
              knucklewalking.",

              chronic stroke. INTERVENTIONS: The experimental group (n = 15)
              performed motor imagery training involving imagining normal gait
              movement for 15 minutes embedded in gait training for 30 minutes
              (45 minutes/day, 3 times/week); the control group (n = 13)

              MEASURES: Balance and gait abilities were measured by the
              Functional Reach Test, Timed Up-and-Go Test, 10-m Walk Test and
              Fugl-Meyer assessment before and after interventions. RESULTS:
              All measurements improved significantly compared with baseline

              Evidence-based practice (EBP) is a process in which the
              rehabilitation clinician integrates the ``best'' research
              evidence, clinical expertise, and patient circumstances, values,
              and preferences to provide the most appropriate interventions to
              address patient expectations and goals. Studies show that
              clinicians value EBP but are challenged by limited time, skills,
              and resources to successfully implement it in real-world
              practice. This article describes a five-step EBP framework and
              directs clinicians to free online resources designed to improve
              their ability to become evidence-based practitioners. The

  author   = "Garc{\'\i}a Carrasco, D and Aboitiz Cantalapiedra, J",
  abstract = "INTRODUCTION: In recent decades, many stroke rehabilitation
              methods have been developed. Mental practice (MP) is a dynamic
              state in which the subject evokes an imaginary representation of
              a motor action or skill in order to learn or perfect that action.
              Although functional imaging has shown that MP produces similar
              cortical activation patterns to those of movement, the clinical
              effectiveness of such methods in rehabilitation and functional
              recovery has yet to be demonstrated. DEVELOPMENT: Systematic
              search of all clinical studies published in the main scientific
              databases between December 2011 and October 2012 concerning
              mental practice in stroke rehabilitation. We selected 23 clinical
              trials testing different MP protocols in patients with
              hemiparesis. CONCLUSIONS: MP is effective when used in
              conjunction with conventional physical therapy for functional
              rehabilitation of both upper and lower limbs, as well as for the
              recovery of daily activities and skills. Owing to the
              heterogeneity of the studies with regard to the intervention

              who have completed rehabilitation after stroke have regained a
              level of automaticity of walking comparable to healthy people of
              similar age. METHOD: Twenty stroke subjects, 20 healthy elderly
              controls and 20 healthy young controls were tested. To quantify
              the automaticity of walking, subjects were required to walk
              simultaneously while performing an additional task(s). Subjects
              walked under four counterbalanced conditions: a single walking
              task, a dual-cognitive task, a dual-manual task and a
              triple-task. Walking velocity, cadence, stride length and step
              length were analysed. RESULTS: Stroke subjects walked slower (p =
              0.001), took shorter strides (p = 0.002) and fewer steps/min (p =
              0.04) than elderly controls. Velocity declined significantly
              across conditions from the single to the dual-cognitive to the
              dual-manual and finally to the triple-task (p < 0.001). Both
              stroke and elderly groups showed similar deterioration in walking
              velocity across conditions (p = 0.99), while the deterioration in
              the young subjects was significantly less than for healthy
              elderly subjects (p = 0.04) and the stroke subjects (p = 0.02).
              CONCLUSION: Community dwelling stroke subjects display the same
              level of automaticity of walking as elderly controls, but both
              elderly controls and stroke subjects are less automated than
              young controls.",

              characteristics in stabilized patients in rehabilitation
              treatment by using an opto-electronic system of analysis (ELITE).
              METHODS: Forty-two hemiplegic patients were entered on this
              study, and mean age was 63.2 years (SD 9.9). The gait measures
              were obtained four times for each patient; at time of baseline,
              at the 15th, 30th and 90th day from the beginning of
              rehabilitation treatment. Plantar flexion moment and ankle joint
              power were always recorded. Forty healthy volunteers served as
              controls. Four stride characteristics were examined: duration,
              length, frequency and speed. ANOVA for repeated measures was
              used. RESULTS: In spite of rehabilitation treatment no results in
              gait were observed after 3 months. A study on patients'
              expectancy was also done. At the beginning they were given a
              simple questionnaire along with DSM-IV CISD-1. None of the
              patients presented with major depression. At admission 38 (90\%)
              patients expected an improvement of the gait. At the end of the
              rehabilitation treatment, 36 (85\%) patients were still confident
              about therapy and believed in further improvements of their
              locomotion, whilst six (15\%) were dubious. CONCLUSIONS: The
              study shows discrepancies between objective results and
              subjective feelings. Psychological factors account for the

              summarizes the findings of that analysis, which indicated that
              the prevalence of disability in 2005 (21.8\%) remained unchanged
              from 1999 (22.0\%); however, because of the aging of the
              population, particularly the large group born during 1946-1964
              (``baby boomers''), the estimated absolute number of persons
              reporting a disability increased 7.7\%, from 44.1 to 47.5
              million. The three most common causes of disability continued to
              be arthritis or rheumatism (affecting an estimated 8.6 million
              persons), back or spine problems (7.6 million), and heart trouble
              (3.0 million). Women (24.4\%) had a significantly higher

              lengthens the step (``pelvic step''). It is often assumed that
              the thorax then starts to counter rotate to limit total body
              angular momentum around the vertical. But the relative timing of
              pelvis and thorax rotation during gait is insufficiently
              understood. The present study aimed at analysing how transverse
              pelvis and thorax rotations relate to the movements of the upper
              leg, and how these patterns contribute to total body angular
              momentum. Nine healthy male volunteers walked on a treadmill at
              nine different velocities, ranging from 2.0 km/h to 5.2 km/h.
              Full body kinematics were recorded. Femur-pelvis, pelvis-thorax,
              and femur-thorax relative phase were calculated, as well as
              transverse plane angular momentum of all body segments. The shift
              in pelvis-thorax coordination from in-phase to out of phase with
              increasing velocity was found to depend on the pelvis beginning
              to move in-phase with the femur, while the thorax continued to
              counter rotate with respect to the femur. Moreover, pelvic and
              thoracic contributions to total body angular momentum were low
              (less than 10\%), while contributions of the legs and arms were
              much larger (approximately 90\%), suggesting that pelvis-thorax
              coordination is relatively unimportant to the organisation of
              total body angular momentum. Taken together, these results may

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Gait analysis is an increasingly used tool in the
              evaluation of neurological or orthopaedic problems in children. A
              good insight into age-related changes in normal paediatric gait
              is necessary to evaluate gait inefficiency caused by pathological
              walking patterns in children. However, no systematic evaluation
              of the normal development of trunk movement has yet been made.
              METHODS: Data of n=85 healthy children were available. They were
              asked to walk at self selected speed. The gait data were measured
              with the Vicon Plug-In-Gait model, including the trunk. We
              assessed gait cycles of thorax, spine and pelvis in the sagittal,
              frontal and transverse plane, respectively, stratified by age
              (categories: <4, 4-6, 7-9, 10-12 and 13-16 years) as well as by
              normalized speed ($\leq$ 0.40, 0.41-0.49, $\geq$ 0.50). RESULTS:
              The sagittal thorax and spine movement was found to be gradually
              and significantly associated with age, but less so with speed,
              indicating that, with increasing age, children tend to lean their
              trunk forward relative to both the global co-ordinate system and
              the pelvis. In contrast, the frontal and transverse parameters of
              spine and pelvic movement seemed to depend mainly on speed, not
              age. CONCLUSION: Our study shows that age dependency has to be
              considered with respect to sagittal thorax and spine movements.

              strategy leading to these changes has not been elucidated. One
              characteristic of joint variation that occurs during walking is
              the close relationship among the joints. This property reduces
              the number of degrees of freedom and seems to be a key issue in
              discussing the tuning strategy. This correlation has been
              analyzed for the lower limbs, but the relation between the trunk
              and lower body is generally ignored. Two questions about posture
              during walking are discussed in this paper: (1) whether there is
              a low-dimensional restriction that determines walking posture,
              which depends not just on the lower limbs but on the whole body,
              including the trunk and (2) whether some simple rules appear in
              different walking conditions. To investigate the correlation,
              singular value decomposition was applied to a measured walking
              pattern. This showed that the whole movement can be described by
              a closed loop on a two-dimensional plane in joint space.
              Furthermore, by investigating the effect of the walking condition
              on the decomposed patterns, the position and the tilt of the
              constraint plane was found to change significantly, while the
              loop pattern on the constraint plane was shown to be robust. This

              The authors conducted a prospective, case control study of
              ambulatory adults older than 70 residing in retirement
              communities. Measurements included spatial and temporal gait

              participants fell to the side, and 64 fell in other directions
              (forward, backward, straight down); 46 participants experienced

              correctly classified 67\% of side-fallers and other-directed

              balance. This was studied on human subjects walking on a

              and timing with respect to the gait cycle by means of a
              computer-controlled pneumatic device. This method has the
              advantage that the same perturbations can be given at different
              phases of the stride cycle, thereby allowing an analysis of the
              phase dependency of the responses in the primary muscles
              involved. After an inward push, e.g., a push toward the left
              during right stance, the left foot in the step to follow is
              placed more to the left (outward strategy). The hypothesis was
              that this movement is caused by automatic unvoluntary muscle
              activity. This turned out to be the case: the abduction movement
              follows EMG responses in the left abductor muscle, gluteus
              medius, in response to the push. Two responses, with latencies of
              100 and 170 ms, and a late reaction >270 ms can be discerned. All
              three responses are phase dependent; they show facilitation in

              walking activity (background). This independence of the

              atrophy. METHODS: One hundred ten elderly adults (aged 65-94
              years, women n = 55) underwent magnetic resonance imaging
              scanning and gait experiments under normal and dual-task walking
              conditions. Linear accelerations of the trunk were measured in
              vertical, anteroposterior, and mediolateral directions using a
              triaxial accelerometer attached to the lower trunk. Gait speed,
              stride length, and cadence were recorded. The harmonic ratio, a
              measure of trunk stability, was computed separately in each
              direction to evaluate the smoothness of trunk movement during
              walking. Brain atrophy was quantitatively assessed using magnetic
              resonance image data. RESULTS: Gait speed, stride length,
              cadence, and harmonic ratio in all directions were lower in
              dual-task walking than in normal walking (p < .05). The

              CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the hypothesis that dual-task
              walking is more cognitively demanding than normal walking.
              Decreased trunk stability during dual-task walking is associated

              slow gait speed, poor endurance, reduced quality and adaptability
              of walking patterns, and an inability to coordinate the legs.
              Estimates based on mechanical work calculations have suggested
              that the paretic leg does 30\% to 40\% of the total mechanical
              work over the gait cycle, regardless of hemiparetic severity, but
              these work estimates may not describe the contribution of each
              leg to forward propulsion. The purpose of this study was to
              establish a quantifiable link between hemiparetic severity and
              paretic leg contribution to propulsion during walking, which we
              propose to quantify using a measure based on the
              anterior-posterior ground reaction forces (A-P GRFs). METHODS: A
              total of 47 participants with chronic hemiparesis walked at
              self-selected speeds to collect spatiotemporal parameters and 3D
              GRFs. A 16-person subset also participated in a pedaling protocol
              to compare A-P GRF measures to established measures of paretic

              walking speed and hemiparetic severity. These measures were also
              strongly correlated with positive work and net work values
              obtained during the pedaling task. The percentage of total
              propulsion generated by the paretic leg (PP) was calculated and
              found to be 16\%, 36\%, and 49\% for those with high, moderate,
              and low hemiparetic severity, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: PP was
              found to provide a quantitative measure of the coordinated output
              of the paretic leg. Further research on this measure of forward
              propulsion may lead to the provision of an effective tool for

              variability was calculated as the standard deviation in step
              lengths, stride widths, pre-swing, swing and stride times.
              Hemiparetic performance was evaluated using lower-extremity

              healthy gait. Paretic leg swing time variability was increased

              Between-leg differences in variability for other spatiotemporal

              Paretic leg propulsion, self-selected walking speed, hemiparetic
              severity (assessed by Brunnstrom stages of motor recovery), and
              some spatiotemporal walking parameters quantified the hemiparetic
              walking performance. Paretic leg propulsion was quantified by the
              paretic propulsion (P(P)) ratio, calculated as the percentage
              contribution of paretic leg to the total propulsive impulse.
              RESULTS: Significant negative correlation (r=-.78) was revealed
              between SLR and P(P), indicating that subjects generating less
              propulsive force with the paretic leg walked asymmetrically with
              longer paretic steps than nonparetic steps. SLR and self-selected
              walking speed revealed a weaker correlation (r=-.35), whereas
              hemiparetic severity correlated strongly with SLR (rho=-.53).
              CONCLUSIONS: Step length asymmetry is related to propulsive force
              generation during hemiparetic walking. Subjects generating least
              paretic propulsion walk with relatively longer paretic steps.
              This suggests that one of the mechanisms for the longer paretic
              step may be the relatively greater compensatory nonparetic leg
              propulsion. Further, those with more severe hemiparesis (those
              dependent on abnormal flexor and extensor synergies) walk with
              the longest paretic steps relative to nonparetic. Finally, our
              results indicated that asymmetrical step lengths may not
              necessarily limit the self-selected walking speed, likely due to
              other compensatory mechanisms.",

              developed by Rosenbaum in which a precue provided partial
              information of the upcoming movement before the stimulus to move.
              Under conditions in which precues were provided by letter symbols
              and stimuli were color-coded dots mapped to response keys.
              Rosenbaum found reaction times to be slower for the specification
              of arm than for direction, and both to be slower than the
              specification of extent. In Experiment 1, using precue and
              stimulus conditions that paralleled those employed by Rosenbaum,
              we obtained very similar findings. The three follow-up
              experiments extended these findings to more naturalized
              stimulus-response compatible conditions. We used a method in
              which precues and stimuli were directly specified through vision
              and mapped in a one-to-one manner with responses. In Experiment
              2, although reacion times decreased as a function of the number
              of parameters precued, there were no systematic effects of
              precuing particular parameters. In Experiments 3 and 4, we
              incorported an ambiguous precue that, while serving to reduce
              task uncertainty, failed to provide any specific information as
              to the arm, direction, or extent of the upcoming movement.
              Initiation times did not systematically vary as a function of the
              type of parameter precued nor were there significant differences

              can be efficiently controlled through appropriate foot placement,

              through swing leg muscle activity, basing this control on the
              mechanical state of the contralateral stance leg. Participants
              walked under Unperturbed and Perturbed conditions, in which foot
              placement was intermittently perturbed by moving the right leg
              medially or laterally during the swing phase (by ∼50-100 mm). We
              quantified mediolateral foot placement, electromyographic
              activity of frontal-plane hip muscles, and stance leg mechanical
              state. During Unperturbed walking, greater swing-phase gluteus
              medius (GM) activity was associated with more lateral foot
              placement. Increases in GM activity were most strongly predicted
              by increased mediolateral displacement between the center of mass
              (CoM) and the contralateral stance foot. The Perturbed walking
              results indicated a causal relationship between stance leg
              mechanics and swing-phase GM activity. Perturbations that reduced
              the mediolateral CoM displacement from the stance foot caused
              reductions in swing-phase GM activity and more medial foot
              placement. Conversely, increases in mediolateral CoM displacement
              caused increased swing-phase GM activity and more lateral foot
              placement. Under both Unperturbed and Perturbed conditions,
              humans controlled their mediolateral foot placement by modulating
              swing-phase muscle activity in response to the mechanical state
              of the contralateral leg. This strategy may be disrupted in

              other foot. The purpose of this study was to quantify foot
              placement patterns relative to body post-stroke and investigate
              its relationship to hemiparetic walking performance. METHODS:
              Thirty-nine participants with hemiparesis walked on a split-belt
              treadmill at their self-selected speeds and 20 healthy
              participants walked at matched slow speeds. Anterior-posterior
              and medial-lateral foot placements (foot center-of-mass) relative
              to body (pelvis center-of-mass) quantified stepping in body
              reference frame. Walking performance was quantified using step
              length asymmetry ratio, percent of paretic propulsion and paretic
              weight support. FINDINGS: Participants with hemiparesis placed
              their paretic foot further anterior than posterior during walking
              compared to controls walking at matched slow speeds (P<.05).
              Participants also placed their paretic foot further lateral
              relative to pelvis than non-paretic (P<.05). Anterior-posterior
              asymmetry correlated with step length asymmetry and percent
              paretic propulsion but some persons revealed differing asymmetry
              patterns in the translating reference frame. Lateral foot
              placement asymmetry correlated with paretic weight support
              (r=.596; P<.001), whereas step widths showed no relation to
              paretic weight support. INTERPRETATION: Post-stroke gait is
              asymmetric when quantifying foot placement in a body reference
              frame and this asymmetry related to the hemiparetic walking
              performance and explained motor control mechanisms beyond those

              developed to determine spatio-temporal gait parameters from trunk
              acceleration data. In a first experiment, predicted gait
              parameters were compared with gait parameters determined from
              ground reaction forces measured by a treadmill. In a second
              experiment, spatio-temporal gait parameters were determined
              during overground walking. From the results of these experiments,
              it is concluded that, in healthy subjects, the duration of
              subsequent stride cycles and left/right steps, and estimations of
              step length and walking speed can be obtained from lower trunk
              accelerations. The possibility to identify subsequent stride
              cycles can be the basis for an analysis of other signals (e.g.
              kinematic or muscle activity) within the stride cycle.",

  title    = "Control of human gait stability through foot placement",
  author   = "Bruijn, Sjoerd M and van Die{\"e}n, Jaap H",
  abstract = "During human walking, the centre of mass (CoM) is outside the
              base of support for most of the time, which poses a challenge to
              stabilizing the gait pattern. Nevertheless, most of us are able
              to walk without substantial problems. In this review, we aim to
              provide an integrative overview of how humans cope with an
              underactuated gait pattern. A central idea that emerges from the
              literature is that foot placement is crucial in maintaining a
              stable gait pattern. In this review, we explore this idea; we
              first describe mechanical models and concepts that have been used
              to predict how foot placement can be used to control gait
              stability. These concepts, such as for instance the extrapolated
              CoM concept, the foot placement estimator concept and the capture
              point concept, provide explicit predictions on where to place the
              foot relative to the body at each step, such that gait is
              stabilized. Next, we describe empirical findings on foot
              placement during human gait in unperturbed and perturbed
              conditions. We conclude that humans show behaviour that is
              largely in accordance with the aforementioned concepts, with foot
              placement being actively coordinated to body CoM kinematics
              during the preceding step. In this section, we also address the
              requirements for such control in terms of the sensory information
              and the motor strategies that can implement such control, as well
              as the parts of the central nervous system that may be involved.
              We show that visual, vestibular and proprioceptive information
              contribute to estimation of the state of the CoM. Foot placement
              is adjusted to variations in CoM state mainly by modulation of
              hip abductor muscle activity during the swing phase of gait, and
              this process appears to be under spinal and supraspinal,
              including cortical, control. We conclude with a description of
              how control of foot placement can be impaired in humans, using
              ageing as a primary example and with some reference to pathology,
              and we address alternative strategies available to stabilize
              gait, which include modulation of ankle moments in the stance leg
              and changes in body angular momentum, such as rapid trunk tilts.
              Finally, for future research, we believe that especially the
              integration of consideration of environmental constraints on foot
              placement with balance control deserves attention.",

              during unanticipated tasks are hypothesized to influence hip and

              cruciate ligament (ACL) injury risk. The aims of this study were
              to examine frontal plane trunk/hip kinematics and hip and knee
              moments (measures of neuromuscular control) during unanticipated
              straight and side step cut tasks. METHODS: Kinematic and kinetic
              variables were collected while subjects performed two anticipated
              tasks, including walking straight (ST) and side step cutting
              (SS), and two unanticipated tasks (STU and SSU). Foot placement,
              thorax-pelvis-hip kinematic variables and hip and knee moments
              were calculated over the first 30\% of stance. FINDINGS: Hip
              abduction angles and knee moments were significantly affected by
              task and anticipation. Hip abduction angles decreased, by 4.0-7.6
              degrees , when comparing the SSU task to the ST, STU and SS
              tasks. The hip abduction angles were associated with foot
              placement and lateral trunk orientation. INTERPRETATION: Hip
              abduction angles and foot placement, not lateral trunk flexion
              influence trunk orientation. Anticipation influences hip and knee
              neuromuscular control and therefore may guide the development of

  abstract = "Previously it has been shown that constraining step width in gait
              coincides with decreased trunk displacements. Conversely,
              external stabilization of the upper body in gait coincides with
              decreased step width, but this may in part be due to changes in
              passive dynamics of the leg. In the present study, trunk
              kinematics during gait were constrained without external
              stabilization by using an orthosis, to investigate whether step
              width and dynamic gait stability in the ML direction are changed
              in relation to trunk kinematics. Nine healthy young adults walked
              on a treadmill at three different speeds with no intervention and
              while wearing a thoracolumbar orthosis. Based on marker
              trajectories, trunk COM displacement, body COM displacement and
              velocity, step width, and margin-of-stability in ML direction
              were calculated. The results showed that the orthosis
              significantly reduced trunk and body COM displacements. As
              hypothesized, the restriction of trunk movement coincided with
              significantly decreased step width, while the margin-of-stability

              of mass were recorded and calculated using two triaxial force
              plates, contact switches, and a video camera system. RESULTS:
              Healthy subjects displayed a high degree of independence of
              kinetic and kinematic parameters of the starting limb.
              Hemiparetic patients showed differences with respect to the

              by the many presentations on fatigue at the 2015 Annual Meeting
              of the American College of Sports Medicine-surprisingly little is
              known about its effect on human performance. There are two main
              reasons for this dilemma: 1) the inability of current terminology
              to accommodate the scope of the conditions ascribed to fatigue,
              and 2) a paucity of validated experimental models. In contrast to
              current practice, a case is made for a unified definition of
              fatigue to facilitate its management in health and disease. On
              the basis of the classic two-domain concept of Mosso, fatigue is
              defined as a disabling symptom in which physical and cognitive
              function is limited by interactions between performance
              fatigability and perceived fatigability. As a symptom, fatigue
              can only be measured by self-report, quantified as either a trait
              characteristic or a state variable. One consequence of such a
              definition is that the word fatigue should not be preceded by an

              a standing position is impaired after stroke. This paper aims to
              review for the first time the factors that impact the ability to
              rise from a chair and identify recommendations for post-stroke
              rehabilitation. METHODS: In order to analyse relevant scientific
              publications (French and English), the search terms ``stroke'',
              ``rehabilitation'' and ``sit-to-stand'' (STS and its variations)
              were used. The initial literature search identified 122 titles
              and abstracts for full review and 46 were retained because both
              the junior and senior researchers agreed that they were aligned
              with the objectives of this review. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION:
              During STS, most individuals with hemiparesis able to stand
              independently presented several changes such as lateral deviation
              of the trunk towards the unaffected side (ipsilesional side),
              asymmetrical weight bearing (WB) and asymmetry of knee moment
              forces. Interestingly, the WB asymmetry was observed even before
              seat-off, when subjects with hemiparesis still had their thighs
              in contact with the chair suggesting a planned strategy. Among
              other interesting results, the time to execute the STS was longer
              than in controls and influenced by the sensorimotor deficits. A
              greater risk of falling was observed with a need for more time to
              stabilize the body during STS and especially during the extension
              phase. Some rehabilitation interventions may be effective in
              improving STS duration, WB symmetry and the ability to stand
              independently with repeated practice (mentally or physically) of
              STS tasks. However, more research is essential to further
              investigate effects of specific training protocols and pursue
              better understanding of this complex and demanding task,
              particularly for stroke patients who need assistance during this

              20-45s were collected from three subject populations (healthy

              routinely used to identify these events. Additional

              electromyography analysis which identified poor bilateral trunk
              muscles activity in patients with stroke. Trunk impairment scale
              is sensitive to evaluate the selective muscle control of upper
              and lower trunk, and it has been reported that lateral flexion of
              the trunk is easier than rotation of the trunk and the clinical
              observation concurs to the difficulty in lower trunk rotation of
              stroke patients. However, trunk exercises given early after
              stroke could produce enhanced balance performance post- stroke.

  author   = "McGill, Stuart M and McDermott, Art and Fenwick, Chad Mj",
  abstract = "Strongman events are attracting more interest as training
              exercises because of their unique demands. Further, strongman
              competitors sustain specific injuries, particularly to the back.
              Muscle electromyographic data from various torso and hip muscles,
              together with kinematic measures, were input to an anatomically
              detailed model of the torso to estimate back load, low-back
              stiffness, and hip torque. Events included the farmer's walk,
              super yoke, Atlas stone lift, suitcase carry, keg walk, tire
              flip, and log lift. The results document the unique demands of
              these whole-body events and, in particular, the demands on the
              back and torso. For example, the very large moments required at
              the hip for abduction when performing a yoke walk exceed the
              strength capability of the hip. Here, muscles such as quadratus
              lumborum made up for the strength deficit by generating frontal
              plane torque to support the torso/pelvis. In this way, the
              stiffened torso acts as a source of strength to allow joints with
              insufficient strength to be buttressed, resulting in successful
              performance. Timing of muscle activation patterns in events such
              as the Atlas stone lift demonstrated the need to integrate the
              hip extensors before the back extensors. Even so, because of the
              awkward shape of the stone, the protective neutral spine posture
              was impossible to achieve, resulting in substantial loading on
              the back that is placed in a weakened posture. Unexpectedly, the
              super yoke carry resulted in the highest loads on the spine. This
              was attributed to the weight of the yoke coupled with the massive
              torso muscle cocontraction, which produced torso stiffness to
              ensure spine stability together with buttressing the abduction
              strength insufficiency of the hips. Strongman events clearly
              challenge the strength of the body linkage, together with the
              stabilizing system, in a different way than traditional
              approaches. The carrying events challenged different abilities
              than the lifting events, suggesting that loaded carrying would
              enhance traditional lifting-based strength programs. This
              analysis also documented the technique components of successful,
              joint-sparing, strongman event strategies.",

              subjects were randomly allocated to one of four groups in this
              pilot study. Changes in weight distribution were compared between
              the 10 subjects of each of three treatment groups (task-specific
              reach, Bobath, or Balance Performance Monitor [BPM] feedback

              sessions with the treatment to which the subject was randomly
              allocated. Measurements were performed using the BPM daily before
              treatment sessions, two weeks after cessation of treatment and 12
              weeks post study. Weight distribution was calculated in terms of
              mean balance (percentage of total body weight) or the mean of 300
              balance points over a 30-s data run. RESULTS: In the short term,
              the Bobath approach was the most effective treatment for
              retraining sitting symmetry after stroke (p = 0.004). Training
              with the BPM and no training were also significant (p = 0.038 and

              29\% of the Bobath group and 0\% of the untrained group were

              postural actions between normal subjects and stroke patients and
              (2) to examine the effects of task demands on the center of
              pressure measures in both groups. DESIGN: Thirteen normal
              subjects and 23 stroke patients performed two trials of forward
              bending of the trunk and reaching for each of the targets at six
              locations at floor level while standing on a 0.5-m-long pressure
              mat. Center of pressure excursion, center of pressure average
              velocity, and bilateral limb weight-bearing ratios characterized
              the postural actions. Mixed-design analysis of variance was used.

              effects was found for all variables except the center of pressure
              average velocity. All variables except center of pressure average

              The posturography of stroke patients was less regular than that

              the body. Step width variability may be affected by active
              control of foot placement subject to noise. We hypothesized that
              age-related deficits may lead to increased step width
              variability. A possible compensation would be to walk with wider
              steps to reduce the lateral instability. The addition of external

              metabolic energy expenditure in eight adult human subjects aged
              less than 30 years (Young) and ten subjects aged at least 65

              present experiments, we tested whether hip abductor
              proprioception influenced the control of mediolateral gait
              motion. Participants performed a series of quiet standing and
              treadmill walking trials. In some trials, 80-Hz vibration was
              applied intermittently over the right gluteus medius (GM) to
              evoke artificial proprioceptive feedback. During walking, the GM
              was vibrated during either right leg stance (to elicit a
              perception that the pelvis was closer mediolaterally to the
              stance foot) or swing (to elicit a perception that the swing leg
              was more adducted). Vibration during quiet standing evoked
              leftward sway in most participants (13 of 16), as expected from
              its predicted perceptual effects. Across the 13 participants
              sensitive to vibration, stance phase vibration caused the
              contralateral leg to be placed significantly closer to the
              midline (by ∼2 mm) at the end of the ongoing step. In contrast,
              swing phase vibration caused the vibrated leg to be placed
              significantly farther mediolaterally from the midline (by ∼2 mm),
              whereas the pelvis was held closer to the stance foot (by ∼1 mm).
              The estimated mediolateral margin of stability was thus decreased

               stroke patients and to assess how it relates to body balance and
               functional disability in this patient group. DESIGN: This
               prospective case-comparison study investigated isometric and
               isokinetic reciprocal trunk flexion and extension strength at
               angular velocities in 38 unihemispheric stroke patients and 40
               healthy volunteers. The Berg balance scale was used to assess
               balance and stability, and the FIM instrument was used to
               evaluate functional disability in the patient group. Patients
               were evaluated as soon as they were able to stand long enough
               for testing. RESULTS: Peak torque values for trunk flexion and
               extension were lower in the stroke patients than in the
               controls. The differences were significant for trunk flexion and
               for trunk extension. In both groups, peak torque values for
               trunk flexors were greater than peak torque values for trunk
               extensors. There was a significant positive correlation between
               trunk muscle strength and Berg balance scale score at discharge.
               Trunk muscle strength was not correlated with FIM total score or
               FIM motor score, but the locomotion-transfers FIM subscore at
               discharge was positively correlated with trunk muscle torque
               values, except for isometric extension. CONCLUSION: The findings
               indicate trunk flexion and extension muscle weakness in
               unihemispheric stroke patients, which can interfere with

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate
               the construct and predictive validity of the Trunk Control Test
               (TCT) in postacute stroke patients by comparing TCT scores at
               admission and discharge with the Functional Independence Measure
               (FIM) scores. METHODS: Forty-nine patients participated in the
               study. The TCT examines four movements: rolling from a supine
               position to the weak side (T1) and to the strong side (T2),
               sitting up from a lying-down position (T3), and sitting balance
               (T4). The FIM is an 18-item scale (13 motor [motFIM] and 5
               cognitive [cognFIM]) used to determine the level of dependence
               of patients in daily life. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients (73\%)
               increased their TCT overall score at discharge. The TCT
               item-total correlations were high, both at admission and
               discharge (P < .0001). The individual TCT items were
               intercorrelated. Furthermore, the homogeneity of the TCT was
               confirmed by a high Cronbach's index. High correlations were
               found between admission and discharge scores in the different
               tests (TCT, FIM, and motFIM; P < .0001) and between TCT at
               admission and FIM (P < .0001) and motFIM (P < .0001) at
               admission. TCT at admission alone explained 71\% of the variance
               in motFIM at discharge. CONCLUSIONS: The TCT showed a good
               sensitivity to change in assessing recovery of stroke patients.
               The high item-total correlation and Cronbach's alpha value of
               the TCT suggest that there is one homogeneous construct
               underlying the item list. The TCT construct validity was
               confirmed by the correlation between this test and the FIM
               scores. TCT at admission predicted motFIM at discharge even
               better than motFIM at admission alone. Possibly, the TCT
               captures basic motor skills that foreshadow the recovery of more
               complex behavioral skills described by the FIM.",

               (ADL) functions at an early stage after a stroke is critical
               because it enables clinicians to set treatment programs and
               goals. The objective of this study was to assess the
               relationship between trunk control at an early stage and
               comprehensive ADL function (as assessed by combining basic ADL
               and instrumental ADL [IADL]) in patients at 6 months after
               stroke. METHODS: A total of 169 stroke patients participated in
               this prospective study. Trunk control was measured with the use
               of the trunk control items of the Postural Assessment Scale for
               Stroke Patients (PASS-TC). In addition to the PASS-TC score,
               age, sex, type of stroke, side of hemiparesis, urinary
               incontinence, limb paresis (measured by the Fugl-Meyer motor
               test), balance (measured by the Fugl-Meyer balance test), and
               basic ADL (measured by the Barthel Index) were also selected as
               predictor variables. These variables were assessed at 14 days
               after stroke or earlier. The Barthel Index and Frenchay
               Activities Index (measuring IADL) were administered at 6 months
               after stroke. The sum of the standardized Barthel Index and
               standardized Frenchay Activities Index scores was used to assess
               comprehensive ADL function. RESULTS: Multivariable stepwise
               linear regression analysis showed that PASS-TC score, age,
               Fugl-Meyer motor test score, and Barthel Index score (listed by
               the order of forward selection) were the strongest predictors of
               comprehensive ADL function. These results were internally
               validated with the use of the bootstrap resampling technique.
               The PASS-TC score alone accounted for 45\% of the variance in
               predicting comprehensive ADL function. Results also indicated
               that the PASS-TC score had slightly more power in predicting
               comprehensive ADL function than either the Fugl-Meyer motor test
               score or Barthel Index score. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this
               study provide strong evidence of the predictive value of trunk
               control on comprehensive ADL function in stroke patients. The
               results imply that early assessment and management of trunk
               control after stroke should be emphasized.",

              three programmes: 10 weeks of stabilisation training (group 1; n
              = 19); 10 weeks of stabilisation training combined with dynamic

              multifidus (LM) morphology in terms of cross-sectional muscle,

              changes in self-experienced functional status of chronic
              nonspecific low back pain (CNSLBP). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA:
              LM morphology is associated with the recurrence of CNSLBP.
              METHODS: Sixteen male patients underwent a dynamic isolated
              resistance-training program for the lower back muscles of
              approximately 10 sessions in 12 weeks. In the next 12 weeks,
              frequency of training was tailored to the patients' need.
              Participants underwent lumbar magnetic resonance imaging at
              baseline (T0), after 12 weeks (T12), and after 24 weeks (T24).
              Functional cross-sectional area was obtained by analyzing the
              magnetic resonance images. Functional status was assessed using
              the patient-specific functional scale, Roland-Morris disability
              questionnaire, and global perceived effect scale. RESULTS:
              Roland-Morris disability questionnaire and patient-specific
              functional scale scores showed significant and clinically
              relevant improvements between baseline and T12, with 44\% and
              39\%, respectively. Between T12 and T24, these scores did not
              change significantly. Seven participants (44\%) reported
              clinically relevant improvements in global perceived effect at
              T12. At T24, 1 more participant reported a relevant global
              perceived effect improvement, whereas 2 participants (13\%)
              reported worsening of their condition. The magnetic resonance
              imaging analysis showed minor nonsignificant changes in
              functional cross-sectional area. CONCLUSION: Our study shows that
              10 weeks of dynamic isolated training of the lumbar extensors,
              once a week, leads to clinically relevant improvements in
              functional status of men with CNSLBP, without accompanying
              improvements in functional cross-sectional area of LM. These
              findings suggest that improvement in LM morphology is not a
              critical success factor in restoring functional status of
              patients with CNSLBP, at least in the short term (6 mo).",

              systematic review with meta-analysis",
  author   = "Smith, Benjamin E and Littlewood, Chris and May, Stephen",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Non-specific low back pain (NSLBP) is a large and
              costly problem. It has a lifetime prevalence of 80\% and results
              in high levels of healthcare cost. It is a major cause for long
              term sickness amongst the workforce and is associated with high
              levels of fear avoidance and kinesiophobia. Stabilisation (or
              'core stability') exercises have been suggested to reduce
              symptoms of pain and disability and form an effective treatment.
              Despite it being the most commonly used form of physiotherapy
              treatment within the UK there is a lack of positive evidence to
              support its use. The aims of this systematic review update is to
              investigate the effectiveness of stabilisation exercises for the
              treatment of NSLBP, and compare any effectiveness to other forms
              of exercise. METHODS: A systematic review published in 2008 was
              updated with a search of PubMed, CINAHL, AMED, Pedro and The
              Cochrane Library, October 2006 to October 2013. Two authors
              independently selected studies, and two authors independently
              extracted the data. Methodological quality was evaluated using
              the PEDro scale. Meta-analysis was carried out when appropriate.
              RESULTS: 29 studies were included: 22 studies (n = 2,258)
              provided post treatment effect on pain and 24 studies (n = 2,359)
              provided post treatment effect on disability. Pain and disability
              scores were transformed to a 0 to 100 scale. Meta-analysis showed
              significant benefit for stabilisation exercises versus any
              alternative treatment or control for long term pain and
              disability with mean difference of -6.39 (95\% CI -10.14 to
              -2.65) and -3.92 (95\% CI -7.25 to -0.59) respectively. The
              difference between groups was clinically insignificant. When
              compared with alternative forms of exercise, there was no
              statistical or clinically significant difference. Mean difference
              for pain was -3.06 (95\% CI -6.74 to 0.63) and disability -1.89
              (95\% CI -5.10 to 1.33). CONCLUSION: There is strong evidence
              stabilisation exercises are not more effective than any other
              form of active exercise in the long term. The low levels of
              heterogeneity and large number of high methodological quality of
              available studies, at long term follow-up, strengthen our current
              findings, and further research is unlikely to considerably alter
              this conclusion.",

  abstract = "STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective cohort design was conducted using
              data from an electronic survey and an existing commercial
              outcomes database. OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical outcomes of
              patients with musculoskeletal conditions treated by physical
              therapists who had completed residency or fellowship programs
              versus those who had not. BACKGROUND: There is an increasing
              focus on specialization through postprofessional education in
              physical therapy residency and fellowship programs. Scant
              evidence exists that evaluates the influence of postprofessional
              clinical education on actual patient outcomes. METHODS: Physical
              therapists using a national outcomes database were surveyed to
              determine their level of postprofessional education. Survey
              responders were categorized into 1 of 3 groups that included no
              residency or fellowship training, residency trained, or
              fellowship trained. Outcomes for 25 843 patients with
              musculoskeletal conditions treated by 363 therapists from June
              2012 to June 2013 were extracted from the database. These data
              were analyzed to identify any differences in functional status
              change and efficiency achieved between the 3 groups. Potentially
              confounding variables were controlled for statistically. RESULTS:
              The fellowship-trained group of physical therapists achieved
              functional status changes and efficiency that were greater than
              those of the other groups. No difference in functional status
              change was observed between the residency group and the
              therapists without residency or fellowship training. The group
              without residency or fellowship training was more efficient than
              the residency-trained group. Fellowship-trained therapists were
              more likely to achieve greater treatment effect sizes than
              therapists without residency or fellowship training.
              Residency-trained therapists were less likely to achieve greater
              treatment effect sizes than the therapists without residency or
              fellowship training. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that
              fellowship training may contribute to statistically greater
              patient outcomes. Residency training did not appear to contribute
              to improved patient functional status change or efficiency. It is
              unknown whether the statistical differences observed would be
              clinically meaningful for patients.",

              effectiveness of these mathematical procedures in accommodating
              for both photogrammetric errors and skin movement artifacts
              depends on the number of markers associated with a given bone as

              minimization of error propagation from marker coordinates to
              bone-embedded frame position and orientation. Findings allow for

              rhythm in the normal shoulder during dynamic elevation of the arm
              in the scapular plane and to compare the scapulohumeral rhythm
              during three different states of loading: 1) arm completely
              unloaded and passively elevated, 2) light load consisting of
              active elevation against the weight of the limb, and 3) heavy
              loading against maximal resistance. Electromagnetic tracking was
              used to record three-dimensional scapular and humeral kinematics
              on 25 normal subjects. Cardan angles were calculated to assess
              the dynamic relationship of humeral elevation to scapular upward
              rotation. The results show that during dynamic humeral elevation
              the scapulohumeral rhythm changes depending on the phase of
              elevation and the external load on the arm. During passive range
              of motion, the scapulohumeral rhythm decreased from 7.9:1 to
              2.1:1 as the arm was elevated. Light shoulder loads caused an
              increase of the scapulohumeral rhythm from 3.1:1 to 4.3:1 as the
              arm was elevated. Heavy shoulder loading resulted in an
              increasing scapulohumeral rhythm from 1.9:1 to 4.5:1 as the arm
              was elevated. The results suggest that the historical assumption
              of a simple linear 2:1 scapulohumeral rhythm ratio may be overly
              simplistic and may not accurately describe the scapulohumeral

              used in the treatment of scapulothoracic dysfunction related to

              imbalances often established in these patients, exercises

              serratus anterior (SA) activation with minimal activity in the
              upper trapezius (UT) are recommended. HYPOTHESIS: Of 12 commonly
              used trapezius strengthening exercises, a selection can be
              performed for muscle balance rehabilitation, based on a low
              UT/LT, UT/MT, or UT/SA muscle ratio. STUDY DESIGN: Controlled
              laboratory study. METHODS: Electromyographic activity of the 3
              trapezius parts and the SA was measured in 45 healthy subjects
              performing 12 commonly described scapular exercises, using
              surface electromyography. RESULTS: For each intramuscular
              trapezius ratio (UT/LT, UT/MT), 3 exercises were selected for
              restoration of muscle balance. The exercises side-lying external
              rotation, side-lying forward flexion, prone horizontal abduction
              with external rotation, and prone extension were found to be the
              most appropriate for intramuscular trapezius muscle balance
              rehabilitation. For the UT/SA ratio, none of the exercises met
              the criteria for optimal intermuscular balance restoration.
              CONCLUSION: In cases of trapezius muscle imbalance, some
              exercises are preferable over others because of their low UT/LT
              and UT/MT ratios. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: In the selection of
              rehabilitation exercises, the clinician should have a preference
              for exercises with high activation of the LT and MT and low

              several basic concepts of kinetic chain-based shoulder

              that the muscle activations and joint motions follow a
              proximal-to-distal pathway along the appropriate kinetic chain.
              2. Muscles around the shoulder function in an integrated fashion
              and should be rehabilitated in integrated patterns. Specific
              muscles may need isolated activation, but this activation should
              be facilitated by placing the proximal segments in a facilitating
              function. 3. Scapular control and coupled rotator cuff activation
              is vital to normal shoulder function. 4. Closed chain axial

              motion between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals during
              shoulder motion performed in 3 planes of humerothoracic
              elevation. BACKGROUND: Differences in scapulothoracic kinematics
              are associated with shoulder pain. Several studies have measured
              these differences using surface sensors, but the results of this
              technique may be affected by skin-motion artifact. Furthermore,
              previous studies have not included the simultaneous measurement
              of sternoclavicular and acromioclavicular joint motion. METHODS:
              Transcortical bone pins were inserted into the clavicle, scapula,
              and humerus of 12 asymptomatic and 10 symptomatic individuals for
              direct, bone-fixed tracking using electromagnetic sensors.
              Angular positions for the sternoclavicular, acromioclavicular,
              and scapulothoracic joints were measured during shoulder flexion,
              abduction, and scapular plane abduction. RESULTS: Differences
              between groups were found for sternoclavicular and
              scapulothoracic joint positions. Symptomatic individuals
              consistently demonstrated less sternoclavicular posterior
              rotation, regardless of angle, phase, or plane of shoulder
              motion. Symptomatic individuals also demonstrated less
              scapulothoracic upward rotation at 30° and 60° of humerothoracic
              elevation during shoulder abduction and scapular plane abduction.
              CONCLUSION: The results of this study show that differences in
              shoulder complex kinematics exist between symptomatic and
              asymptomatic individuals. However, the magnitude of these
              differences was small, and the resulting clinical implications
              are not yet fully understood. The biomechanical coupling of the
              sternoclavicular and acromioclavicular joints requires further
              research to better understand scapulothoracic movement deviations
              and to improve manual therapy and exercise-based physical therapy

              in glenohumeral joint angular motion and linear translations
              between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals during shoulder
              motion performed in 3 planes of humerothoracic elevation.
              BACKGROUND: Numerous clinical theories have linked abnormal
              glenohumeral kinematics, including decreased glenohumeral
              external rotation and increased superior translation, to
              individuals with shoulder pain and impingement diagnoses.
              However, relatively few studies have investigated glenohumeral
              joint angular motion and linear translations in this population.
              METHODS: Transcortical bone pins were inserted into the scapula
              and humerus of 12 asymptomatic and 10 symptomatic participants
              for direct bone-fixed tracking using electromagnetic sensors.
              Glenohumeral joint angular positions and linear translations were
              calculated during active shoulder flexion, abduction, and
              scapular plane abduction. RESULTS: Differences between groups in
              angular positions were limited to glenohumeral elevation,
              coinciding with a reduction in scapulothoracic upward rotation.
              Symptomatic participants demonstrated 1.4 mm more anterior
              glenohumeral translation between 90° and 120° of shoulder flexion
              and an average of 1 mm more inferior glenohumeral translation
              throughout shoulder abduction. CONCLUSION: Differences in
              glenohumeral kinematics exist between symptomatic and
              asymptomatic individuals. The clinical implications of these
              differences are not yet understood, and more research is needed

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Physical therapy (PT) is often prescribed for
              patients with rotator cuff tears. The extent to which PT
              influences strength, range of motion (ROM), and patient-reported
              outcomes has been studied extensively, but the effect of PT on in
              vivo joint kinematics is not well understood. PURPOSE: To assess
              the influence of symptomatic rotator cuff pathology and the
              effects of PT on shoulder motion, strength, and patient-reported
              outcomes. STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study. METHODS:
              Twenty-five patients with a symptomatic rotator cuff tear and 25
              age-matched asymptomatic control subjects were recruited.
              Shoulder motion was measured using a biplane radiography imaging
              system, strength was assessed with a Biodex dynamometer, and
              patient-reported outcomes were assessed using the Western Ontario
              Rotator Cuff Index and visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores.
              Data were acquired from the patients before and after 8 weeks of
              physical therapy. Data were acquired at 1 time point for the
              control subjects. RESULTS: Compared with the control subjects,
              patients with a symptomatic rotator cuff tear had significantly
              worse pain/function scores (P < .01); less ROM (P < .01); lower
              abduction (ABD), external rotation (ER), and internal rotation
              (IR) strength (P < .01); less scapulothoracic posterior tilt (P =
              .05); and lower glenohumeral joint elevation (P < .01). Physical
              therapy resulted in improved pain/function scores (P < .01),
              increased ROM (P < .02), increased scapulothoracic posterior tilt
              (P = .05), increased glenohumeral joint elevation (P = .01), and
              decreased acromiohumeral distance (AHD) (P = .02). CONCLUSION:
              Compared with age-matched controls, patients had worse
              pain/function scores, less ROM, and lower ABD, ER, and IR
              strength. Patients also had less scapulothoracic anteroposterior
              tilt, less glenohumeral joint elevation, and an altered
              glenohumeral joint contact path. PT resulted in improved
              pain/function scores, increased ROM, greater posterior
              scapulothoracic tilt, increased glenohumeral joint elevation, an
              increased range of superoinferior joint contact, and a lower mean
              AHD. Of these differences, PT only returned scapulothoracic tilt
              to control levels. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study documents the
              effects of PT on shoulder motion and conventional clinical
              outcomes. It is expected that understanding how changes in joint
              motion are associated with conventional clinical outcomes will
              lead to improved nonoperative interventions for patients with
              rotator cuff tears.",

  abstract = "PURPOSE: To quantitatively measure the 3-dimensional (3D)
              glenohumeral translations during dynamic shoulder abduction in
              the scapular plane, using a biplane fluoroscopy system, in
              patients with supraspinatus rotator cuff tears. METHODS: A custom
              biplane fluoroscopy system was used to measure the 3D position
              and orientation of the scapula and humerus of 14 patients with
              full-thickness supraspinatus or supraspinatus and infraspinatus
              rotator cuff tears and 10 controls as they performed shoulder
              abduction over their full range of motion. The 3D geometries of
              the scapula and humerus were extracted from a computed tomography
              scan of each shoulder. For each frame, the 3D bone position and
              orientation were estimated using a contour-based matching
              algorithm, and the 3D position of the humeral head center was
              determined relative to the glenoid. For each subject the
              superior-inferior and anterior-posterior translation curves were
              determined from 20° through 150° of arm elevation. RESULTS: The
              humeral head in shoulders with rotator cuff tears was positioned
              significantly inferior compared with controls for higher
              elevation angles of 80° to 140° (P < .05). For both groups the
              humeral head translated inferiorly during shoulder abduction from
              80° (P = .044; rotator cuff tear v controls: -0.2 $\pm$ 1.3 v 1.2
              $\pm$ 1.4 mm) up to 140° (P = .047; rotator cuff tear v controls:
              -1.3 $\pm$ 2.2 v 0.44 $\pm$ 1.4 mm). There was no significant
              translation in the anterior- posterior direction. CONCLUSIONS:
              Patients with well-compensated single or 2-tendon rotator cuff
              tears show no dynamic superior humeral head migration but
              unexpectedly show an inferior shift during active elevation. It
              is unclear whether the size of the translational differences
              found in this study, while statistically significant, are also of

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Glenohumeral subluxation (GHS) is a common poststroke
              complication. Treatment of GHS is hampered by the lack of
              objective, real-time clinical measurements. OBJECTIVE: The aims
              of this study were: (1) to compare an ultrasound method of GHS
              measurement with the fingerbreadth palpation method using a
              receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) and (2) to report
              the sensitivity and specificity of this method. DESIGN: A
              prospective study was conducted. SETTING: The study was conducted
              in local hospitals and day centers in the southwest of England.
              PATIENTS: One hundred five patients who had one-sided weakness
              following a first-time stroke (51 men, 54 women; mean age=71
              years, SD=11) and who gave informed consent were enrolled in the
              study. MEASUREMENTS: Ultrasound measurements of acromion-greater
              tuberosity (AGT) distance were used for the assessment of GHS.
              Measurements were undertaken on both shoulders by a research
              physical therapist trained in shoulder ultrasound with the
              patient seated in a standardized position. Fingerbreadth
              palpation assessment of GHS was undertaken by a clinical physical
              therapist based at the hospital, who also visited the day
              centers. RESULTS: The area under the ROC curve was 0.73 (95\%
              confidence interval [95\% CI]=0.63, 0.83), suggesting that the
              ultrasound method has good agreement compared with the
              fingerbreadth palpation method. A cutoff point of $\geq$0.2 cm
              AGT measurement difference between affected and unaffected
              shoulders generated a sensitivity of 68\% (95\% CI=51\%, 75\%), a
              specificity of 62\% (95\% CI=47\%, 80\%), a positive likelihood
              ratio of 1.79 (95\% CI=1.1, 2.9), and a negative likelihood ratio
              of 0.55 (95\% CI=0.4, 0.8). LIMITATIONS: Clinical therapists
              involved in the routine care of patients conducted the
              fingerbreadth palpation method. It is likely that they were aware
              of the patients' subluxation status. CONCLUSION: The ultrasound
              method can detect minor asymmetry ($\leq$0.5 cm) and has the
              potential advantage over the fingerbreadth palpation method of
              identifying patients with minor subluxation.",

              hemiplegic shoulder. Participants with a diagnosis of acute
              stroke and severe upper limb motor impairment were included. From
              24-h post stroke and continuing every three days until discharge,
              measurements of shoulder pain (visual analogue scale, Ritchie

              the severity of upper limb motor impairment, pain and reduced
              PROM were seen in a small number of participants. The clinical
              course of shoulder pain and PROM following stroke remains

              singularly or in clusters. Quality assessment and statistical
              parameters were designed for inclusion criteria to determine
              diagnostic data for special test selection for the proposed
              algorithm. RESULTS: In the proposed shoulder examination
              algorithm, 15 of 26 special tests achieved the proposed
              statistical diagnostic threshold parameters for clinical utility.
              Achievement of proposed statistical diagnostic threshold
              parameters was accomplished for 6 pathological shoulder
              conditions; while 3 pathological shoulder conditions did not
              achieve these criteria. DISCUSSION: Large, randomized controlled
              trials that include patient history and all facets of the
              physical examination are lacking in the literature. Should
              diagnostic physical examination testing become more accurate, it
              is very possible that improved research can be accomplished, in
              order to establish clinical practice guidelines to help guide
              examination and treatment, patient management, and improve
              patient outcomes. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 1A.",

              evaluating at least one conservative intervention against sham or
              other treatments. RESULTS: For pain, exercise was superior to
              non-exercise control interventions (standardised mean difference
              (SMD) -0.94, 95\% CI -1.69 to -0.19). Specific exercises were
              superior to generic exercises (SMD -0.65, 95\% CI -0.99 to
              -0.32). Corticosteroid injections were superior to no treatment
              (SMD -0.65, 95\% CI -1.04 to -0.26), and ultrasound guided
              injections were superior to non-guided injections (SMD -0.51,
              95\% CI -0.89 to -0.13). Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
              (NSAIDS) had a small to moderate SMD of -0.29 (95\% CI -0.53 to
              -0.05) compared with placebo. Manual therapy was superior to
              placebo (SMD -0.35, 95\% CI -0.69 to -0.01). When combined with
              exercise, manual therapy was superior to exercise alone, but only
              at the shortest follow-up (SMD -0.32, 95\% CI -0.62 to -0.01).
              Laser was superior to sham laser (SMD -0.88, 95\% CI -1.48 to
              -0.27). Extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ECSWT) was superior to
              sham (-0.39, 95\% CI -0.78 to -0.01) and tape was superior to
              sham (-0.64, 95\% CI -1.16 to -0.12), with small to moderate
              SMDs. CONCLUSION: Although there was only very low quality
              evidence, exercise should be considered for patients with
              shoulder impingement symptoms and tape, ECSWT, laser or manual
              therapy might be added. NSAIDS and corticosteroids are superior

  author   = "Green, S and Buchbinder, R and Hetrick, S",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The prevalence of shoulder disorders has been
              reported to range from seven to 36\% of the population (Lundberg
              1969) accounting for 1.2\% of all General Practitioner encounters
              in Australia (Bridges Webb 1992). Substantial disability and
              significant morbidity can result from shoulder disorders. While
              many treatments have been employed in the treatment of shoulder
              disorders, few have been proven in randomised controlled trials.
              Physiotherapy is often the first line of management for shoulder
              pain and to date its efficacy has not been established. This
              review is one in a series of reviews of varying interventions for
              shoulder disorders, updated from an earlier Cochrane review of
              all interventions for shoulder disorder. OBJECTIVES: To determine
              the efficacy of physiotherapy interventions for disorders
              resulting in pain, stiffness and/or disability of the shoulder.
              SEARCH STRATEGY: MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Clinical Trials
              Regiter and CINAHL were searched 1966 to June 2002. The Cochrane
              Musculoskeletal Review Group's search strategy was used and key
              words gained from previous reviews and all relevant articles were
              used as text terms in the search. SELECTION CRITERIA: Each
              identified study was assessed for possible inclusion by two
              independent reviewers. The determinants for inclusion were that
              the trial be of an intervention generally delivered by a
              physiotherapist, that treatment allocation was randomised; and
              that the study population be suffering from a shoulder disorder,
              excluding trauma and systemic inflammatory diseases such as
              rheumatoid arthritis. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The
              methodological quality of the included trials was assessed by two
              independent reviewers according to a list of predetermined
              criteria, which were based on the PEDro scale specifically
              designed for the assessment of validity of trials of
              physiotherapy interventions. Outcome data was extracted and
              entered into Revman 4.1. Means and standard deviations for
              continuous outcomes and number of events for binary outcomes were
              extracted where available from the published reports. All
              standard errors of the mean were converted to standard deviation.
              For trials where the required data was not reported or not able
              to be calculated, further details were requested from first
              authors. If no further details were provided, the trial was
              included in the review and fully described, but not included in
              the meta-analysis. Results were presented for each diagnostic sub
              group (rotator cuff disease, adhesive capsulitis, anterior
              instability etc) and, where possible, combined in meta-analysis
              to give a treatment effect across all trials. MAIN RESULTS:
              Twenty six trials met inclusion criteria. Methodological quality
              was variable and trial populations were generally small (median
              sample size = 48, range 14 to 180). Exercise was demonstrated to
              be effective in terms of short term recovery in rotator cuff
              disease (RR 7.74 (1.97, 30.32), and longer term benefit with
              respect to function (RR 2.45 (1.24, 4.86). Combining mobilisation
              with exercise resulted in additional benefit when compared to
              exercise alone for rotator cuff disease. Laser therapy was
              demonstrated to be more effective than placebo (RR 3.71 (1.89,
              7.28) for adhesive capsulitis but not for rotator cuff
              tendinitis. Both ultrasound and pulsed electromagnetic field
              therapy resulted in improvement compared to placebo in pain in
              calcific tendinitis (RR 1.81 (1.26, 2.60) and RR 19 (1.16, 12.43)
              respectively). There is no evidence of the effect of ultrasound
              in shoulder pain (mixed diagnosis), adhesive capsulitis or
              rotator cuff tendinitis. When compared to exercises, ultrasound
              is of no additional benefit over and above exercise alone. There
              is some evidence that for rotator cuff disease, corticosteroid
              injections are superior to physiotherapy and no evidence that
              physiotherapy alone is of benefit for Adhesive Capsulitis
              REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: The small sample sizes, variable
              methodological quality and heterogeneity in terms of population
              studied, physiotherapy intervention employed and length of follow
              up of randomised controlled trials of physiotherapy interventions
              results in little overall evidence to guide treatment. There is
              evidence to support the use of some interventions in specific and
              circumscribed cases. There is a need for trials of physiotherapy
              interventions for specific clinical conditions associated with
              shoulder pain, for shoulder pain where combinations of
              physiotherapy interventions, as well as, physiotherapy
              interventions as an adjunct to other, non physiotherapy
              interventions are compared. This is more reflective of current
              clinical practice. Trials should be adequately powered and
              address key methodological criteria such as allocation
              concealment and blinding of outcome assessor.",

  author   = "Peterson, Carrie L and Kautz, Steven A and Neptune, Richard R",
  abstract = "The ability to accelerate and decelerate is important for daily
              activities and likely more demanding than maintaining a
              steady-state walking speed. Walking speed is modulated by
              anterior-posterior (AP) ground reaction force (GRF) impulses. The
              purpose of this study was to investigate AP impulses across a
              wide range of speeds during accelerated and decelerated walking.
              Kinematic and GRF data were collected from 10 healthy subjects
              walking on an instrumented treadmill. Subjects completed trials
              at steady-state speeds and at four rates of acceleration and
              deceleration across a speed range of 0-1.8 m/s. Mixed regression
              models were generated to predict AP impulses, step length and
              frequency from speed, and joint moment impulses from AP impulses
              during non-steady-state walking. Braking and propulsive impulses
              were positively related to speed. The braking impulse had a
              greater relationship with speed than the propulsive impulse,
              suggesting that subjects modulate the braking impulse more than
              the propulsive impulse to change speed. Hip and knee extensor,
              and ankle plantarflexor moment impulses were positively related
              to the braking impulse, and knee flexor and ankle plantarflexor
              moment impulses were positively related to the propulsive
              impulse. Step length and frequency increased with speed and were
              near the subjects' preferred combination at steady-state speeds,
              at which metabolic cost is minimized in nondisabled walking.
              Thus, these variables may be modulated to minimize metabolic cost
              while accelerating and decelerating. The outcomes of this work
              provide the foundation to investigate motor coordination in
              pathological subjects in response to the increased task demands
              of non-steady-state walking.",

              in hemiparetic walking",
  author   = "Peterson, Carrie L and Cheng, Jing and Kautz, Steven A and
              Neptune, Richard R",
  abstract = "Forward propulsion is a central task of walking that depends on
              the generation of appropriate anterior-posterior ground reaction
              forces (AP GRFs). The AP impulse (i.e., time integral of the AP
              GRF) generated by the paretic leg relative to the non-paretic leg
              is a quantitative measure of the paretic leg's contribution to
              forward propulsion and is variable across hemiparetic subjects.
              The purpose of this study was to investigate the underlying
              mechanisms of propulsion generation in hemiparetic walking by
              identifying the biomechanical predictors of AP impulses.
              Three-dimensional kinematics and GRFs were recorded from 51
              hemiparetic and 21 age-matched control subjects walking at
              similar speeds on an instrumented treadmill. Hierarchical
              regression models were generated for each leg to predict the AP
              impulse from independent biomechanical variables. Leg extension
              was a significant predictor and positively related to the
              propulsive impulse in the paretic, non-paretic and control legs.
              Secondarily, the hip flexor moment impulse was negatively related
              to the propulsive impulse. Also, the relationship of paretic and
              non-paretic ankle moments with the propulsive impulse depended on
              the paretic step ratio, suggesting the plantar flexor
              contribution to the propulsive impulse depends on leg angle.
              These results suggest that increasing paretic leg extension will
              increase propulsion. Increasing paretic plantar flexor output and
              decreasing paretic hip flexor output could also increase paretic
              leg propulsion. While increased pre-swing hip flexor output has
              been suggested to compensate for decreased plantar flexor output,
              such output may further impair propulsion by the paretic leg if
              it occurs too soon in the gait cycle.",

              directed at the cervical and thoracic spine may improve outcomes
              in patients with shoulder pain. To date, limited data are
              available to help physical therapists determine which patients
              with shoulder pain may experience changes in pain and disability
              following the application of these interventions. OBJECTIVE: The
              purpose of this study was to identify prognostic factors from the
              history and physical examination in individuals with shoulder
              pain who are likely to experience rapid improvement in pain and
              disability following cervical and thoracic spine manipulation.
              DESIGN: This was a prospective single-arm trial. SETTING: This
              study was conducted in outpatient physical therapy clinics.
              PARTICIPANTS: The participants were individuals who were seen by
              physical therapists for a primary complaint of shoulder pain.
              INTERVENTION AND MEASUREMENTS: Participants underwent a
              standardized examination and then a series of thrust and
              nonthrust manipulations directed toward the cervicothoracic
              spine. Individuals were classified as having achieved a
              successful outcome at the second and third sessions based on
              their perceived recovery. Potential prognostic variables were
              entered into a stepwise logistic regression model to determine
              the most accurate set of variables for prediction of treatment
              success. RESULTS: Data for 80 individuals were included in the
              data analysis, of which 49 had a successful outcome. Five
              prognostic variables were retained in the final regression model.
              If 3 of the 5 variables were present, the chance of achieving a
              successful outcome improved from 61\% to 89\% (positive
              likelihood ratio=5.3). LIMITATIONS: A prospective single-arm
              trial lacking a control group does not allow for inferences to be
              made regarding cause and effect. The statistical procedures used
              may result in ``overfitting'' of the model, which can result in
              low precision of the prediction accuracy, and the bivariate
              analysis may have resulted in the rejection of some important
              variables. CONCLUSIONS: The identified prognostic variables will
              allow clinicians to make an a priori identification of
              individuals with shoulder pain who are likely to experience
              short-term improvement with cervical and thoracic spine

              the chance of experiencing a successful outcome improved from
              54\% to 86\%. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The CPR provides the
              ability to a priori identify patients with neck pain who are
              likely to experience early success with thoracic spine thrust

              OBJECTIVE: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of common
              clinical examination items and to construct a preliminary
              clinical prediction rule for diagnosing hip osteoarthritis (OA)
              in individuals with unilateral hip pain. BACKGROUND: The current
              gold standard for the diagnosis of hip OA is a standing
              anteroposterior (AP) radiograph of the pelvis. Other than for
              Altman's criteria, little research has been done to determine the
              accuracy of clinical examination findings for diagnosing hip OA.
              METHODS AND MEASURES: Seventy-two subjects completed the study.
              Each subject received a standardized history, physical
              examination, and standing AP radiograph of the pelvis. Subjects
              with a Kellgren and Lawrence score of 2 or higher based on the
              radiographs were considered to have definitive hip OA. Likelihood
              ratios (LRs) were computed to determine which clinical
              examination findings were most diagnostic of hip OA. Potential
              predictor variables were entered into a logistic regression model
              to determine the most accurate set of clinical examination items
              for diagnosing hip OA. RESULTS: Twenty-one (29\%) of the 72
              subjects had radiographic evidence of hip OA. A clinical
              prediction rule consisting of 5 examination variables was
              identified. If at least 4 of 5 variables were present, the
              positive LR was equal to 24.3 (95\% confidence interval:
              4.4-142.1), increasing the probability of hip OA to 91\%.
              CONCLUSION: The preliminary clinical prediction rule provides the
              ability to a priori identify patients with hip pain who are
              likely to have hip OA. A validation study should be done before
              the rule can be implemented in routine clinical practice.",

              interventions exist due, in part, to complex issues associated

              describe steps, outcomes, and issues involved in
              developing/implementing an evidenced-based fall prevention
              program in community settings. METHODS: The Stay In Balance
              program (SIB), developed by a team of professionals, local
              service providers and active older adults, was carried out with
              total of 135 older adults in several steps: developing objectives
              and program content, laboratory-based randomized controlled trial
              (RCT), pilot program in the community, community-based RCT, and
              implementation at 2 community sites. RESULTS: Each step in

              mobility are major risk factors for falls. OBJECTIVE: The purpose
              of this study was to examine effects of Feldenkrais exercises in
              improving balance, mobility, and balance confidence in older
              adults. METHODS: Participants (N = 47, mean age 75.6) were
              randomly assigned to a Feldenkrais group (FG, n = 25) or to a
              control group (CG, n = 22). The FG group attended a 5-week
              Feldenkrais program, 60 minutes three times per week, while the
              CG group was a waitlist control. The outcome measures were
              balance (tandem stance), mobility (Timed Up and Go), gait
              characteristics (GAITRite Walkway System), balance confidence
              (Balance Confidence Scale; ABC), and fear of falling (Falls
              Efficacy Scale). Pre- and post-tests were conducted. RESULTS:
              After completion of the program, balance (p = 0.030) and mobility
              (p = 0.042) increased while fear of falling (p = 0.042) decreased
              significantly for the FG group. No other significant changes were
              observed. However, participants of the FG group showed
              improvements in balance confidence (p = 0.054) and mobility while
              performing concurrently a cognitive task (p = 0.067).
              CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that Feldenkrais exercises
              are an effective way to improve balance and mobility, and thus
              offer an alternative method to help offset age-related declines
              in mobility and reduce the risk of falling among
              community-dwelling older adults. A long-term follow-up study of
              balance and mobility is warranted. Further research is needed to
              identify whether Feldenkrais exercises may impact cognitive

              increase of .10m/s was not clinically meaningful. Change in

               corticomotor drive with the paretic and nonparetic plantarflexor
               muscles was related to the biomechanical ankle moment strategy
               that people with chronic stroke used to achieve their greatest
               walking speeds. Rehabilitation strategies that promote
               corticomotor balance might improve poststroke walking mechanics
               and enhance functional ambulation. Objective: The study
               objectives were to test the effectiveness of a single session of
               gait training using functional electrical stimulation (FES) to
               improve plantarflexor corticomotor symmetry and plantarflexion
               ankle moment symmetry and to determine whether changes in
               corticomotor symmetry were related to changes in ankle moment
               symmetry within the session. Design: This was a
               repeated-measures crossover study. Methods: On separate days, 20
               people with chronic stroke completed a session of treadmill
               walking either with or without the use of FES of their ankle
               dorsi- and plantarflexor muscles. We calculated plantarflexor
               corticomotor symmetry using transcranial magnetic stimulation
               and plantarflexion ankle moment symmetry during walking between
               the paretic and the nonparetic limbs before and after each
               session. We compared changes and tested relationships between
               corticomotor symmetry and ankle moment symmetry following each
               session. Results: Following the session with FES, there was an
               increase in plantarflexor corticomotor symmetry that was related
               to the observed increase in ankle moment symmetry. In contrast,
               following the session without FES, there were no changes in
               corticomotor symmetry or ankle moment symmetry. Limitations: No
               stratification was made on the basis of lesion size, location,
               or clinical severity. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate,
               for the first time (to our knowledge), the ability of a single

              focused on improving walking speed because it is a reliable
              measurement that is associated with quality of life. Previous
              studies have demonstrated that propulsion, the force used to
              propel the body forward, determines walking speed. However, there
              are several different ways of measuring propulsion and no studies
              have identified which measurement best reflects differences in
              walking speed. The primary purposes of this study were to
              determine for individuals poststroke, which measurement of
              propulsion (1) is most closely related to their self-selected
              walking speeds and (2) best reflects changes in walking speed
              within a session. Participants (N=43) with chronic poststroke
              hemiparesis walked at their self-selected and maximal walking
              speeds on a treadmill. Propulsive impulse, peak propulsive force,
              and mean propulsive value (propulsive impulse divided by
              duration) were analyzed. In addition, each participant׳s cadence
              was calculated. Pearson correlation coefficients were used to
              determine the relationships between different measurements of
              propulsion versus walking speed as well as changes in propulsion
              versus changes in walking speed. Stepwise linear regression was
              used to determine which measurement of propulsion best predicted
              walking speed and changes in walking speed. The results showed
              that all 3 measurements of propulsion were correlated to walking
              speed, with peak propulsive force showed the strongest
              correlation. Similarly, when participants increased their walking
              speeds, changes in peak propulsive forces showed the strongest
              correlation to changes in walking speed. In addition, multiplying
              each measurement by cadence improved the correlations. The
              present study suggests that measuring peak propulsive force and
              cadence may be most appropriate of the variables studied to
              characterize propulsion in individuals poststroke.",

              focuses on increasing walking speed because it is an indicator of
              community walking ability and quality of life. Propulsive force
              generated from the paretic limb is critical to walking speed and
              may reflect actual neural recovery that restores the affected
              neural systems. A wide variation across individuals in the
              improvements in paretic propulsive force was observed following
              an intervention that targeted paretic propulsive force. This
              study aimed to determine if specific baseline characteristics can
              be used to predict patients who would respond to the
              intervention. METHODS: Participants (N = 19) with chronic
              poststroke hemiparesis walked at their self-selected and maximal
              walking speeds on a treadmill before and after a 12-week gait
              training program. Propulsive forces from the paretic limb were
              analyzed. Pearson correlation coefficient was used to determine
              the relationships between (1) treatment gains in walking speed
              and propulsive force following intervention, and (2) treatment
              gains in propulsive force and baseline propulsive forces.
              RESULTS: Treatment gains in self-selected walking speed were
              correlated to treatment gains in paretic propulsive force
              following intervention. In addition, changes in paretic
              propulsive force between self-selected and maximal walking speeds
              at baseline were strongly correlated to treatment gains in
              paretic propulsive force. CONCLUSIONS: The capacity to modulate
              paretic propulsive force, rather than the absolute propulsive
              force during self-selected or maximal walking speed, predicted
              treatment gains in propulsive force following the intervention.

              stimulation and biomechanical testing at their self-selected and
              fastest walking speeds. Plantarflexor corticomotor symmetry
              (CS(PF)) was calculated as a ratio of the average paretic versus
              nonparetic soleus motor evoked potential amplitude. The ratio of
              the paretic and nonparetic peak ankle plantarflexion moments
              (PF(sym)) was calculated at each speed. RESULTS: CS(PF) predicted
              the $\Delta$PF(sym) from self-selected and fastest speeds
              (R(2)=.629, F(1,21)=35.56, p<.001). An interaction between CS(PF)

              Both trailing limb angle and ankle moment increased during speed

              contribution of the paretic versus the nonparetic propulsive
              forces to changes in walking speed. OBJECTIVE: The primary
              purpose of this study was to determine the contribution of
              propulsive force generated from each limb to changes in walking
              speed during speed modulation within a session and as a result of
              a 12-week training program. METHODS: Gait analysis was performed
              as participants (N = 38) with chronic poststroke hemiparesis
              walked at their self-selected and faster walking speeds on a
              treadmill before and after a 12-week gait retraining program.
              RESULTS: Prior to training, stroke survivors increased nonparetic
              propulsive forces as the primary mechanism to change walking
              speed during speed modulation within a session. Following gait
              training, the paretic limb played a larger role during speed
              modulation within a session. In addition, the increases in

              contributed to the increases in the self-selected walking speeds
              seen following training. CONCLUSIONS: Gait retraining in the
              chronic phase of stroke recovery facilitates paretic limb
              neuromotor recovery and reduces the reliance on the nonparetic
              limb's generation of propulsive force to increase walking speed.

              post-stroke is self-selected walking speed, yet individuals may
              achieve the same speed using different coordination strategies.
              Asymmetry in the propulsion generated by each leg can provide
              insight into paretic leg coordination due to its relatively
              strong correlation with hemiparetic severity. Subjects walking at
              the same speed can exhibit different propulsion asymmetries, with
              some subjects relying more on the paretic leg and others on the
              nonparetic leg. The goal of this study was to assess whether
              analyzing propulsion asymmetry can help distinguish between
              improved paretic leg coordination versus nonparetic leg
              compensation. METHODS: Three-dimensional forward dynamics
              simulations were developed for two post-stroke hemiparetic
              subjects walking at identical speeds before/after rehabilitation
              with opposite changes in propulsion asymmetry. Changes in the
              individual muscle contributions to forward propulsion were
              examined. FINDINGS: The major source of increased forward
              propulsion in both subjects was from the ankle plantarflexors.
              How they were utilized differed and appears related to changes in
              propulsion asymmetry. Subject A increased propulsion generated
              from the paretic plantarflexors, while Subject B increased
              propulsion generated from the nonparetic plantarflexors. Each
              subject's strategy to increase speed also included differences in
              other muscle groups (e.g., hamstrings) that did not appear to be
              related to propulsion asymmetry. INTERPRETATION: The results of
              this study highlight how speed cannot be used to elucidate
              underlying muscle coordination changes following rehabilitation.
              In contrast, propulsion asymmetry appears to provide insight into
              changes in plantarflexor output affecting propulsion generation
              and may be useful in monitoring rehabilitation outcomes.",

  abstract = "Restoring functional gait speed is an important goal for
              rehabilitation post-stroke. During walking, transferring of one's
              body weight between the limbs and maintaining balance stability
              are necessary for independent functional gait. Although it is
              documented that individuals post-stroke commonly have
              difficulties with performing weight transfer onto their paretic
              limbs, it remains to be determined if these deficits contributed
              to slower walking speeds. The primary purpose of this study was
              to compare the weight transfer characteristics between slow and
              fast post-stroke ambulators. Participants (N=36) with chronic
              post-stroke hemiparesis walked at their comfortable and maximal
              walking speeds on a treadmill. Participants were stratified into
              2 groups based on their comfortable walking speeds ($\geq$0.8m/s
              or <0.8m/s). Minimum body center of mass (COM) to center of
              pressure (COP) distance, weight transfer timing, step width,
              lateral foot placement relative to the COM, hip moment, peak
              vertical and anterior ground reaction forces, and changes in
              walking speed were analyzed. Results showed that slow walkers
              walked with a delayed and deficient weight transfer to the
              paretic limb, lower hip abductor moment, and more lateral paretic
              limb foot placement relative to the COM compared to fast walkers.
              In addition, propulsive force and walking speed capacity was
              related to lateral weight transfer ability. These findings
              demonstrated that deficits in lateral weight transfer and
              stability could potentially be one of the limiting factors
              underlying comfortable walking speeds and a determinant of
              chronic stroke survivors' ability to increase walking speed.",
