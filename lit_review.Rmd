# Introduction 

In individuals post-stroke, transitioning from one speed-based functional category to the next is associated with improved quality of life and reduced disability [@Schmid.2007]. A central challenge of rehabilitation is that though a variety of interventions are able to improve walking speed after stroke, the magnitude of the improvement is regularly insufficient to transition into a higher category of ambulation [@Dickstein.2008]. It is particularly difficult to transition from being a limited community ambulator to an unlimited community ambulator, which involves a comfortable walking speed increase from between 0.4 and 0.8 m/s to beyond 0.8 m/s [@Schmid.2007]. 

Suggestively, a walking speed of approximately 0.8 m/s has been identified as a transitional point above which the rotation of the pelvis begins to couple with the movement of the femurs resulting in the "pelvic step" [@Bruijn.2008; @Wagenaar.1992]. This anti-phase coupling of the thorax and pelvis is evident in the self-selected speeds of healthy individuals, where larger amplitudes of frontal and transverse plane movement has been associated with faster walking speeds [@Thummerer.2012]. In contrast, individuals post-stroke have demonstrated more in-phase coupling of the thorax and pelvis relative to healthy controls who walk at a faster self-selected pace [@Hacmon.2012]. 

Though more abnormal trunk movement appears to be associated with more pronounced limb impairments, intrinsic trunk deficits may also contribute to observed abnormal trunk movements [@vanCriekinge.2020]. While unilateral limb weakness is a defining characteristic of hemiparesis, it is important to recognize that the trunk is also be effected by stroke. These effects include trunk weakness bilaterally and in all three planes [@Bohannon.1992; @Karatas.2004; @Tanaka.1997], as well as impairments in anticipatory postural adjustments and muscle recruitment times [@Dickstein.2004; @Dickstein.2004b]. 

Clinical tests of trunk function soon after stroke are more strongly correlated with Functional Independence Measure scores than measures of upper-extremity or lower-extremity function [@Likhi.2013]. Beyond concurrent correlations with function, clinical tests of trunk function soon after stroke have also been shown to be predictive of long-term functional outcomes [@Duarte.2002; @Hsieh.2002; @Verheyden.2007]. 

Gait speed increases post-stroke are driven by increases in propulsive force, particularly on the paretic side [@Hsiao.2016c]. Descriptions of the mechanism used to generate propulsive force have emphasized the role of limb components such as the plantar flexors  [@Neptune.2001] and the trailing limb angle [@Hsiao.2015]. The lack of a trunk-inclusive model of force production limits our ability to understand the relative significance of intrinsic limb and trunk impairments. This undermines our ability to appropriately prioritize impairments for treatment in a clincial setting.

The dual significance of a 0.8 m/s gait speed as both a barrier to unlimited community ambulation, and a transitional point to a walking pattern that requires more trunk coordination is highly suggestive. The strong relationship between intrinsic trunk impairments following stroke and long-term function underscores the potential significance of a framework for understanding propulsive force generation that can account for the trunk deviations apparent in individuals with hemiparesis.
