# Introduction 

In individuals with hemiparesis following stroke, transitioning from one speed-based functional category to the next is associated with improved quality of life and reduced disability [@Schmid.2007]. Though a variety of interventions are able to improve walking speed in this population, the magnitude of the improvement is regularly insufficient to transition into a higher functional category [@Dickstein.2008]. It is particularly difficult to transition from being a limited community ambulator to an unlimited community ambulator, which involves increasing comfortable walking speed beyond 0.8 m/s [@Schmid.2007]. 

Suggestively, a walking speed of approximately 0.8 m/s has also been identified as a transitional speed beyond which the rotation of the pelvis begins to couple with the movement of the femurs resulting in the "pelvic step" [@Bruijn.2008; @Wagenaar.1992]. This results in an anti-phase coupling of the thorax and pelvis in healthy gait, where larger amplitudes of frontal and transverse plane movement is associated with faster walking [@Thummerer.2012]. In contrast, individuals post-stroke demonstrate more in-phase coupling of the thorax and pelvis relative to healthy controls who walk at a faster self-selected pace [@Hacmon.2012]. 

Though more abnormal trunk movement appears to be associated with more pronounced limb impairments, intrinsic trunk deficits may also be a contributing factor [@vanCriekinge.2020]. While unilateral limb weakness is a defining characteristic of hemiparesis, the trunk is also be effected by stroke. These effects include trunk weakness bilaterally and in all three planes [@Bohannon.1992; @Karatas.2004; @Tanaka.1997], as well as impairments in anticipatory postural adjustments and muscle recruitment times [@Dickstein.2004; @Dickstein.2004b]. 

Soon after stroke, clinical tests of trunk impairment correlate more strongly with Functional Independence Measure scores than tests of upper-extremity or lower-extremity impairments [@Likhi.2013]. Beyond concurrent correlations with function, clinical tests of trunk impairments soon after stroke have also been shown to be predictive of long-term functional outcomes [@Duarte.2002; @Hsieh.2002; @Verheyden.2007]. 

Gait speed increases post-stroke are driven by increases in propulsive force, particularly on the paretic side [@Hsiao.2016c]. Descriptions of the mechanism used to generate propulsive force have emphasized the role of limb components such as the plantar flexors  [@Neptune.2001] and the trailing limb angle [@Hsiao.2015]. The lack of a trunk-inclusive model of force production limits our ability to understand the relative significance of limb impairments vs. trunk impairments. This undermines our ability to prioritize treatments in a clinical setting and devise novel interventions.

Walking at a speed of 0.8 m/s carries a dual significance: it is a transitional point to a walking pattern that requires trunk control that is regularly impaired by stroke; and it stands as a barrier to unlimited community ambulation that individuals post-stroke often struggle to surpass. The relationship between post-stroke trunk impairments and long-term function highlights the potential significance of a framework for propulsive force generation that accounts for the idiosyncratic trunk movements observed in individuals with hemiparesis.
